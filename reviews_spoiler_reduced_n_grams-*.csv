0,"I originally gave this three stars, but it was so close to four that I decided not to be miserly, and bumped it up by one. If you have a kid (and when I say kid I mean a young to middling teenager, or maybe an advanced pre-teen) who likes to read scary stories, they might be into this. It had a very Outer Limits/Twilight Zone kind of feel. This is apparently meant as a middle grades book, and the storytelling style is like that, but some of the elements seem a bit too gruesome for that. (One thing in particular, which I'll detail at the end behind a spoiler tag.) It scared me at points, but my threshold for being scared by things is kind of low. I was scared when I saw The Blair Witch Project, and I'm assured that only total wimps were scared by that. Thematically, this is about friendship, not conforming to ideals of normalcy and perfection, and the temptation to try to change people. I feel like the story elements were not manipulated with maximum deftness, but they are handled reasonably well. I really liked the visual design of the book. The endpapers have a pattern of creepy bugs on them, and throughout the text drawings of small bugs appeared in the margins. There is one thing that's gross, though. I saw it coming, but I winced anyway when it was confirmed, because ew. Soylent Green is made of people! i.e., there's cannibalism here. Even if you look at it as a metaphor for how the non-conformers get eaten up, it seems a bit gratuitous. This author apparently has books forthcoming over the next couple of years, and I'd be willing to give them a try.",4,children,"['originally', 'give_star', 'close', 'decide', 'miserly', 'bump', 'kid', 'kid', 'mean', 'young', 'middling', 'teenager', 'maybe', 'advanced', 'pre_teen', 'like', 'read', 'scary', 'story', 'outer', 'limits', 'twilight', 'zone', 'kind', 'feel', 'apparently', 'mean', 'middle_grade', 'book', 'storytelling', 'style', 'like', 'element', 'bit', 'gruesome', 'thing', 'particular', 'detail', 'end', 'spoiler_tag', 'scare', 'point', 'threshold', 'scare', 'thing', 'kind', 'low', 'scared', 'see', 'blair', 'witch', 'project', 'assure', 'total', 'wimp', 'scare', 'thematically', 'friendship', 'conform', 'ideal', 'normalcy', 'perfection', 'temptation', 'try', 'change', 'people', 'feel', 'like', 'story', 'element', 'manipulate', 'maximum', 'deftness', 'handle', 'reasonably', 'like', 'visual', 'design', 'book', 'endpaper', 'pattern', 'creepy', 'bug', 'text', 'drawing', 'small', 'bug', 'appear', 'margin', 'thing', 'gross', 'see', 'come', 'wince', 'confirm', 'ew', 'soylent', 'green', 'people', 'cannibalism', 'look', 'metaphor', 'non', 'conformer', 'eat', 'bit', 'gratuitous', 'author', 'apparently', 'book', 'forthcoming', 'couple', 'year', 'willing', 'try']"

2,"This story follows a family consisting of a father, mother, a boy, and a girl. The kids' father becomes obsessed with his work after he was let go from his job. He spends all day working in the family's basement, and becomes furious if anyone ventures into his work area. After the father is found eating plant food and having leaves grow out of his head, he confesses that he is working on a plant/animal hybrid. The father continues to act weird and is found sleeping with dirt and insects in his bed, and the suit of his previous boss after he comes to visit. Eventually, the kids find a clone of their dad and his previous boss in the basement. A decision must be made as to who is the real dad. The girl cuts one of them who bleeds red, and assumes that it his her dad. She also knows this because he uses her nickname which the plant-clone had not been using for days. I liked this story a lot more than the first book in the series (Welcome to Dead House). Not only did I enjoy the exploration of experimenting with nature and the catastrophic results that it can have, but it also seemed a lot scarier to me. It also explored themes of questioning authority in the form of the kids' parents. I don't think that as a kid I would have been able to see through the plot as well as I did as not only an adult, but an adult who had read this book (at least once) as a kid. There was a lot of foreshadowing however, and I remembered the ending quite vividly. So while the ending may be predictable it is one that will stick with you. The story burrowed A LOT of elements of Invasion of the Body Snatchers such as the plants cloning people and hiding the humans and the clones that have little/no emotion. The biggest difference between the two books is the origin of the ""plants,"" where in this book it's DNA mutation while in Body Snatchers they are of an alien descent. With the first Goosebumps books, I was afraid that I was remembering this series with rose colored glasses, and that although I would enjoy reading through the series as an adult, but that they would not hold up very well and I wouldn't enjoy them as much as an adult. This book seemed to put that fear to rest, and I can honestly say that I also enjoyed this book as an adult.",5,children,"['story', 'follow', 'family', 'consist', 'father', 'mother', 'boy', 'girl', 'kid', 'father', 'obsessed', 'work', 'let', 'job', 'spend', 'day', 'work', 'family', 'basement', 'furious', 'venture', 'work', 'area', 'father', 'find', 'eat', 'plant', 'food', 'have', 'leave', 'grow', 'head', 'confess', 'work', 'plant', 'animal', 'hybrid', 'father', 'continue', 'act', 'weird', 'find', 'sleep', 'dirt', 'insect', 'bed', 'suit', 'previous', 'boss', 'come', 'visit', 'eventually', 'kid', 'find', 'clone', 'dad', 'previous', 'boss', 'basement', 'decision', 'real', 'dad', 'girl', 'cut', 'bleed', 'red', 'assume', 'dad', 'know', 'use', 'nickname', 'plant', 'clone', 'day', 'like', 'story', 'lot', 'book', 'series', 'welcome', 'dead', 'house', 'enjoy', 'exploration', 'experiment', 'nature', 'catastrophic', 'result', 'lot', 'scary', 'explore', 'theme', 'question', 'authority', 'form', 'kid', 'parent', 'think', 'kid', 'able', 'plot', 'adult', 'adult', 'read', 'book', 'kid', 'lot', 'foreshadowing', 'remember', 'ending', 'vividly', 'ending', 'predictable', 'stick', 'story', 'burrow', 'lot', 'element', 'invasion', 'body', 'snatchers', 'plant', 'clone', 'people', 'hide', 'human', 'clone', 'little', 'emotion', 'big', 'difference', 'book', 'origin', 'plant', 'book', 'dna', 'mutation', 'body', 'snatchers', 'alien', 'descent', 'goosebumps', 'book', 'afraid', 'remember', 'series', 'rose', 'colored', 'glass', 'enjoy', 'read', 'series', 'adult', 'hold', 'enjoy', 'adult', 'book', 'fear', 'rest', 'honestly', 'enjoy', 'book', 'adult']"
3,"I don't remember reading this book in school, so I decided to give it a try. Lois Lowry is an incredible story teller. Even though it was a relatively short story, I didn't feel like there was anything missing. The story is told in such a way that you don't realize how different that world is until it is mentioned. I got to the part about  how there is no color in the world   and it felt like a bomb had been dropped because I had no idea. Terrific writing! If you haven't read this I suggest you do!",4,children,"['remember', 'read', 'book', 'school', 'decide', 'try', 'lois', 'lowry', 'incredible', 'story', 'teller', 'relatively', 'short_story', 'feel', 'like', 'missing', 'story', 'tell', 'way', 'realize', 'different', 'world', 'mention', 'get', 'color', 'world', 'feel', 'like', 'bomb', 'drop', 'idea', 'terrific', 'writing', 'read', 'suggest']"
4,"Read for the 2016 YA/MG Book Battle. This book was simply charming. I fell in love with the Penderwick family, both immediate and extended. Birdsall has a real gift for characterization that shows throughout the story, even in the most marginal of side characters (like the kindergarten twins who fall in love with Ben). I had some trouble keeping the three older sisters separate at first, but I'm sure that's because I haven't read any of the other books in the series--a deficiency I plan to remedy immediately. (Why did I read these out of order? Because I'm reading it for the Book Battle 2016 and I wanted to come at it unspoiled. The things I do for friends.) Batty, who's arguably the hero (though her brother Ben takes the narrative frequently), is shy, and one of the things I loved about the book was how life kept challenging her to rise above her shyness. The description of how she essentially made a deal with herself to be able to pass out flyers for her business was perfect--as was the way that business became something she never dreamed of. Her mental hangups, particularly her guilt over the death of her beloved dog, are exactly those of an eleven-year-old, and we see so clearly through her eyes that they feel serious even as I knew with my adult perspective that they're unfounded. I could go on with a series of ""I loved""s--I loved Batty and Ben's relationships with their older friends, especially Jeffrey and Nick; I loved Batty's discovery of her voice and how it felt so precious to her; I loved pretentious Oliver and how Rosalind was the only one who didn't know everyone else disliked him; I loved the dogs and how full of personality they were. But what really struck me was the big twist in the middle: Batty overhears a conversation in which one of her sisters ""reveals"" that the reason their mother died of cancer was because she couldn't be treated for it while she was pregnant--that she gave up her life and all they got in return was Batty. It's a devastating secret to learn, but what makes it work is that Batty is eleven and at the perfect age to take it uncritically, where an older child or adult might question whether Skye's perspective is really valid. It hurt to see her suffer through all the days she carries the secret with her, but what I thought was truly effective was how she doesn't regain her center immediately upon learning the truth. That has to wait for a second epiphany, and that one comes through music--just as it should. I couldn't help comparing this to A Ring of Endless Light, which it faced off against in this year's Book Battle. Both are stories about family and friendship, but where I felt A Ring of Endless Light depicted an unrealistically ""cool"" family, with their affectations and seven-year-olds enjoying Shakespeare, this book has a family that seems incredibly familiar to me, for all it's nothing like the one I grew up in. The character voices are so authentic I found myself wishing to be part of their circle. I'm looking forward to reading more about the Penderwicks, wherever their story takes them.",5,children,"['read', 'ya', 'mg', 'book', 'battle', 'book', 'simply', 'charming', 'fall_love', 'penderwick', 'family', 'immediate', 'extended', 'birdsall', 'real', 'gift', 'characterization', 'show', 'story', 'marginal', 'character', 'like', 'kindergarten', 'twin', 'fall_love', 'ben', 'trouble', 'keep', 'old', 'sister', 'separate', 'sure', 'read', 'book', 'series', 'deficiency', 'plan', 'remedy', 'immediately', 'read', 'order', 'read', 'book', 'battle', 'want', 'come', 'unspoiled', 'thing', 'friend', 'batty', 'arguably', 'hero', 'brother', 'ben', 'take', 'narrative', 'frequently', 'shy', 'thing', 'love', 'book', 'life', 'keep', 'challenge', 'rise', 'shyness', 'description', 'essentially', 'deal', 'able', 'pass', 'flyer', 'business', 'perfect', 'way', 'business', 'dream', 'mental', 'hangup', 'particularly', 'guilt', 'death', 'beloved', 'dog', 'exactly', 'year_old', 'clearly', 'eye', 'feel', 'know', 'adult', 'perspective', 'unfounded', 'series', 'love', 'batty', 'ben', 'relationship', 'old', 'friend', 'especially', 'jeffrey', 'nick', 'love', 'batty', 'discovery', 'voice', 'feel', 'precious', 'love', 'pretentious', 'oliver', 'rosalind', 'know', 'dislike', 'love', 'dog', 'personality', 'strike', 'big', 'twist', 'middle', 'batty', 'overhear', 'conversation', 'sister', 'reveal', 'reason', 'mother', 'die', 'cancer', 'treat', 'pregnant', 'give', 'life', 'get', 'return', 'batty', 'devastating', 'secret', 'learn', 'make', 'work', 'batty', 'perfect', 'age', 'uncritically', 'old', 'child', 'adult', 'question', 'skye', 'perspective', 'valid', 'hurt', 'suffer', 'day', 'carry', 'secret', 'think', 'truly', 'effective', 'regain', 'center', 'immediately', 'learn', 'truth', 'wait', 'second', 'epiphany', 'come', 'music', 'help', 'compare', 'ring', 'endless', 'light', 'face', 'year', 'book', 'battle', 'story', 'family', 'friendship', 'feel', 'ring', 'endless', 'light', 'depict', 'unrealistically', 'cool', 'family', 'affectation', 'seven', 'year_old', 'enjoy', 'shakespeare', 'book', 'family', 'incredibly', 'familiar', 'like', 'grow', 'character', 'voice', 'authentic', 'find', 'wish', 'circle', 'look_forward', 'read', 'penderwicks', 'story', 'take']"
5,"I actually enjoyed this book a lot more than I expected to! It was probably a little longer than was necessary, and at times in the last 1/3 or so, it felt like the author was almost in over her head with everything that was going on. But overall it was really enjoyable and very reminiscent of Roald Dahl. The beginning reminded me so much of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Tabitha's parents were right up there with Matilda's parents as the worst parents ever. I loved the setting and the English mystery atmosphere. Tabitha was such an endearing character, trying her best to remain positive despite having such a miserable life! And her friendship with Pemberley was pretty adorable, too. (And I'm not a mouse person, ha.) I thought her fascination with the Inspector Pensive mystery series was a nice touch, and I even liked the excerpts from those (nonexistent) books at the beginning of each chapter. I figured from the beginning that the Countess wasn't the real Countess...she was way too psychotic and crazy. And I thought that the ""ghosts"" were probably people behind the walls. But the whole twin thing near the end did surprise me. (Oh, so many twins!) I really liked this charming little book and would recommend it to any fans of Roald Dahl.",4,children,"['actually', 'enjoy', 'book', 'lot', 'expect', 'probably', 'little', 'long', 'necessary', 'time', 'feel', 'like', 'author', 'head', 'go', 'overall', 'enjoyable', 'reminiscent', 'roald_dahl', 'beginning', 'remind', 'charlie', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'tabitha', 'parent', 'right', 'matilda', 'parent', 'bad', 'parent', 'love', 'setting', 'english', 'mystery', 'atmosphere', 'tabitha', 'endearing', 'character', 'try', 'good', 'remain', 'positive', 'despite', 'have', 'miserable', 'life', 'friendship', 'pemberley', 'pretty', 'adorable', 'mouse', 'person', 'ha', 'think', 'fascination', 'inspector', 'pensive', 'mystery', 'series', 'nice', 'touch', 'like', 'excerpt', 'nonexistent', 'book', 'beginning', 'chapter', 'figure', 'beginning', 'countess', 'real', 'countess', 'way', 'psychotic', 'crazy', 'think', 'ghost', 'probably', 'people', 'wall', 'twin', 'thing', 'near', 'end', 'surprise', 'oh', 'twin', 'like', 'charming', 'little', 'book', 'recommend', 'fan', 'roald_dahl']"
6,"Georges' family has to move from his Brooklyn home to a nearby apartment, where he meets Safer, a kid his age who runs a Spy Club and is sure that Mr. X, who lives above Georges, is murdering people in his apartment and taking them out of the building in suitcases. Over the span of a few weeks, Georges learns a lot about friends, bullies, spies, and family. Both Safer's family and his own have their own secrets, and Georges has to redefine reality and friendship by the end of the book. I read this on my Kindle and started it one night and finished it the next. The suspense was not heart-pounding or scary, but I really, really wanted to know what was going to happen. I knew from an article I read that things were not what they seemed, and that knowledge probably fueled my curiosity. This was an engrossing read with main characters I really liked. Safer is fairly agoraphobic, and that's why he never leaves the apartment building. The Spy Club thing was a sign his little sister put up years before, and he just kind of made the whole thing up as they went along. Meanwhile, Georges' mom wasn't working double shifts as a nurse during this period--she contracted a bacterial disease from a patient and was hospitalized herself. Georges is in denial of that fact and is protecting himself by pretending that she's just at work.

7,"Roald Dahl is the perfect children's author. He takes kids seriously; there are real consequences for adventures here. His books are perfectly constructed. * I can't imagine having a child and not having Dahl's complete works available for him or her. This book apparently comes under fire for being sexist, and I get that. I don't agree, though; after all, the wisest and kindest character is the kid's grandmother. And while Dahl does go out of his way to point out that all witches are women, he goes on to mention that all ghouls and barghests are men. And also, Matilda exists. * Well, almost perfectly; I kept wondering what happened to the mice William and Mary.",5,children,"['roald_dahl', 'perfect', 'child', 'author', 'take', 'kid', 'seriously', 'real', 'consequence', 'adventure', 'book', 'perfectly', 'construct', 'imagine', 'have', 'child', 'have', 'dahl', 'complete', 'work', 'available', 'book', 'apparently', 'come', 'fire', 'sexist', 'agree', 'wise', 'kind', 'character', 'kid', 'grandmother', 'dahl', 'way', 'point', 'witch', 'woman', 'go', 'mention', 'ghoul', 'barghest', 'man', 'matilda', 'exist', 'perfectly', 'keep', 'wonder', 'happen', 'mouse', 'william', 'mary']"
8,"The first time I read this book was at the age of 12 because a close friend recommended it. The cover was colorful and the story was interesting. I remember it was fascinating the way the factory was described. But, for the life of me, I had forgotten about the Oompa-Loompas. The movie brought back memory. A certain book does need a movie so it can paint the thing readers can only imagine. What so grand about a boy who visited a chocolate factory? Duh, the factory itself. I'm not a child anymore but, I would like to go there. And that's what amazing about this book. RD had written it, especially about the factory, so vivid that I once wished it was real. Great book not just for kids but, for adult too. [READ AT YOUR OWN PERIL] 11-year-old Charlie Bucket lives in poverty in a tiny house with his parents and four grandparents. His grandparents share the only bed in the house, located in the only bedroom. Charlie and his parents sleep on a mattress on the floor. One day, Grandpa Joe tells him about the legendary and eccentric chocolatier, Willy Wonka and all the wonderful candy he made until the other candymakers sent in spies to steal his secret recipes, which lead him to close the factory forever. The next day, the newspaper announces that Mr. Wonka is reopening the factory and has invited five children to come on a tour, after they find a golden ticket in a Wonka Bar. Each ticket find is a media sensation and each finder becomes a celebrity. The first four golden tickets are found by the gluttonous Augustus Gloop, the spoiled and petulant Veruca Salt, the gum-addicted Violet Beauregarde, and the TV-obsessed Mike Teavee. One day, Charlie sees a fifty-pence coin (dollar bill in the US version) buried in the snow. He then buys himself a Wonka Bar and finds the fifth golden ticket and shows it to his parents. The ticket says he can bring any family members with him to the factory and Charlie's parents decide to allow Grandpa Joe to go with him. After meeting Mr. Wonka, the kids and their parents go inside where they meet Oompa-Loompas, a race of small people who help Mr. Wonka operate the factory since he rescued them from poverty and fear in their home country Loompaland. The other kids are ejected from the factory in comical, mysterious and painful ways. Augustus gets sucked up the pipe after falling into the Chocolate River in the Chocolate Room, Violet blows up into a giant blueberry after sampling an experimental three-course chewing gum meal in the Inventing Room, Veruca is thrown down the garbage chute in the Nut Room after the nut-testing squirrels consider her a ""bad nut,"" and Mike gets shrunk after he tries to be the first person to be sent by television in the Television Room's Television Chocolate Technology. With only Charlie remaining, Mr. Wonka congratulates him for ""winning"" the factory and, after explaining his true age and the reason behind his golden tickets, names Charlie his successor. They ride the Great Glass Elevator to Charlie's house while the other four children go home after their demises (Augustus squeezed thin, Violet all blue in the face, Veruca covered in garbage, and Mike stretched ten feet tall). Afterwards, Mr. Wonka invites them to come live with him in the factory.",4,children,"['time', 'read', 'book', 'age', 'close', 'friend', 'recommend', 'cover', 'colorful', 'story', 'interesting', 'remember', 'fascinating', 'way', 'factory', 'describe', 'life', 'forget', 'oompa', 'loompas', 'movie', 'bring', 'memory', 'certain', 'book', 'need', 'movie', 'paint', 'thing', 'reader', 'imagine', 'grand', 'boy', 'visit', 'chocolate', 'factory', 'duh', 'factory', 'child', 'anymore', 'like', 'amazing', 'book', 'rd', 'write', 'especially', 'factory', 'vivid', 'wish', 'real', 'great', 'book', 'kid', 'adult', 'read', 'peril', 'year_old', 'charlie', 'bucket', 'live', 'poverty', 'tiny', 'house', 'parent', 'grandparent', 'grandparent', 'share', 'bed', 'house', 'locate', 'bedroom', 'charlie', 'parent', 'sleep', 'mattress', 'floor', 'day', 'grandpa', 'joe', 'tell', 'legendary', 'eccentric', 'chocolatier', 'willy', 'wonka', 'wonderful', 'candy', 'candymaker', 'send', 'spy', 'steal', 'secret', 'recipe', 'lead', 'close', 'factory', 'forever', 'day', 'newspaper', 'announce', 'wonka', 'reopen', 'factory', 'invite', 'child', 'come', 'tour', 'find', 'golden_ticket', 'wonka', 'bar', 'ticket', 'find', 'medium', 'sensation', 'finder', 'celebrity', 'golden_ticket', 'find', 'gluttonous', 'augustus', 'gloop', 'spoiled', 'petulant', 'veruca', 'salt', 'gum', 'addict', 'violet', 'beauregarde', 'tv', 'obsess', 'mike', 'teavee', 'day', 'charlie', 'see', 'pence', 'coin', 'dollar', 'bill', 'version', 'bury', 'snow', 'buy', 'wonka', 'bar', 'find', 'fifth', 'golden_ticket', 'show', 'parent', 'ticket', 'say', 'bring', 'family_member', 'factory', 'charlie', 'parent', 'decide', 'allow', 'grandpa', 'joe', 'meet', 'wonka', 'kid', 'parent', 'inside', 'meet', 'oompa', 'loompas', 'race', 'small', 'people', 'help', 'wonka', 'operate', 'factory', 'rescue', 'poverty', 'fear', 'home', 'country', 'loompaland', 'kid', 'eject', 'factory', 'comical', 'mysterious', 'painful', 'way', 'augustus', 'gets', 'suck', 'pipe', 'fall', 'chocolate', 'river', 'chocolate', 'room', 'violet', 'blow', 'giant', 'blueberry', 'sample', 'experimental', 'course', 'chewing', 'gum', 'meal', 'inventing', 'room', 'veruca', 'throw', 'garbage', 'chute', 'nut', 'room', 'nut', 'test', 'squirrel', 'consider', 'bad', 'nut', 'mike', 'gets', 'shrink', 'try', 'person', 'send', 'television', 'television', 'room', 'television', 'chocolate', 'technology', 'charlie', 'remain', 'wonka', 'congratulate', 'win', 'factory', 'explain', 'true', 'age', 'reason', 'golden_ticket', 'name', 'charlie', 'successor', 'ride', 'great', 'glass', 'elevator', 'charlie', 'house', 'child', 'home', 'demise', 'augustus', 'squeeze', 'thin', 'violet', 'blue', 'face', 'veruca', 'cover', 'garbage', 'mike', 'stretch', 'foot', 'tall', 'wonka', 'invite', 'come', 'live', 'factory']"
9,"I must review this book now. Why, you ask? Because some of the reviews do such a piss-poor job of capturing the magic that makes this book great for young adults and a winner of the 1994 John Newbery Medal, ""For The Most Distinguished Contribution to American Literature for Children."" This book is not likely to blow the socks off an experienced vet of the best English literature has to offer. So don't start the book expecting to find a realistic portrayal of a dystopian society along the lines of some of the science fiction greats. Instead, expect to find a touching story of a young boy as he enters his place in society, only to uncover all the deception surrounding what he has been told as gospel. Jonas's coming-of-age ritual is to stand in front of his community with the rest of the twelve-year-olds and take his adult role. But something strange and unexpected happens, when normally nothing in his society happens out of the ordinary. Cue movie theme song: ""I'm just an ordinary human..."" Briefly, Jonas doesn't fit in and he is given a very special honor. One revelation after another eventually leads him to the conclusion that he can't fit into this monstrous society and he leaves, against all odds, to go ""Elsewhere"". Of particular disappointment to maintaining a cohesive plot is that, with 40 pages left in a 180-page book, they start killing babies. Correction. Not just anyone starts killing babies, the main character's father kills babies. He takes a newborn, fresh out of the womb, weighs it, and then kills it in cold blood, stabbing it in the head with a needle and crooning to it like some sociopath. Next up for execution: the very baby boy the family has grown attached to because it lives at their house. Yes, the book has to end somehow. So, WITH LESS THAN 20 PAGES LEFT, Jonas impulsively scraps whatever plans he had to graciously leave the community and sets out ill-prepared into the wider world to face whatever adversity lurks in God's natural world, away from climate control and Sameness. And let me tell you, the finale may hold up for the limitless imagination of a young teenager, but following any reread or the rational mind of an adult, and the illogical twists and turns necessary to achieve the required affect only serves to highlight how the author has done this to a substantially lesser degree throughout the story. There are a number of fallacies and mathematical impossibilities in the text and they probably won't be noticed by most readers because the author leads you right past them. I don't think pointing out these flaws does much to critique the story besides discrediting the author's opinion by hoping to show carelessness in the writing. Unfortunately, Keely's dissertation on the twisted political undertones of this fictional children's story and some other criticisms I've read have taken hold of me. I've been forced to reevaluate this old favorite of mine from when I understood that the author may have an agenda after all, even if it flies over most kid's awareness. The book is about social control and social freedoms, how society only gives one perspective (the mainstream) to the next generation so they can perpetuate the same morality over and over and over into the future. But nobody's presenting the real truths in their arguments. Even parents tell ""white lies"" to prevent themselves from contradicting themselves. It's about atheism and socialism and abortion and what happens when man plays God with his world. With a mature perspective now, I assert my wish that the author had shown more restraint in the anti-abortion symbolism and message of the finale. Jonas plays the role of mother as he nurtures the child and puts its needs ahead of his own. He is determined to keep the baby even though his parents tell him he's just acting out of emotion, while they have determined it is unrealistic. He runs away from home, trusting in faith to get him through and the memories to help him. A good old-fashioned miracle caps it all off. But I saw none of this the first two times I read the book. Younger readers will enjoy the clear, consistent writing style and the creative names and memorable expressions: ""We accept your apology"" and ""Thank you for your childhood"" and ""Back and back and back"". Lowry makes the big, bad world seem like an overwrought school system, with its rules and social inclusion/exclusion. Lowry captures the pleasures and horrors of life in memorable, vivid detail, all transmitted through the caring hands of an old man. And schoolchildren may rethink the war games they play on the playground. The book is about culture and society, so, even though the writing is easy to read, expect sparse description surrounding most characters. It's about troubling situations and new experiences, emotional reactions and bonds. There is just enough there to tell the story, and not really even enough words there to tell the ending.

I was so curious when I started reading to figure out how Rump's world fit into this one and I LOVED it. The way the Giants are the people of Rump's world and they are in famine, which we know from the last book, but this book explains why. The idea that there are giants living up in the sky and stealing people/food/animals is crazy but it actually works really well in this story.

16,"This came to my attention when it got mentioned in a group I'm in, and it looked like something I might like. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work for me. It starts by introducing us - at length - to the four main characters and their fears. First we see them individually, and then as they start to come together. But this extended intro doesn't really add anything new, it's just the same sort of introductions to their phobia-induced quirks over and over again. We finally get to the school and meet the quirky headmistress, who calls the kids contestants and treats everything like a beauty pageant. Yeah - quirky is all well and good, but you need more than that to move a story along. For the first, heck, 75% of the book nothing much happens, the characters were more annoying than sympathetic, and Wellington is pretty much a bully. I was tempted to DNF it a couple of times, to be honest, and probably would've if I were not such a completionist. Plus I figured I could push through since it's at least short. Anyway - it did pick up towards the end and was actually marginally interesting, but it was also pretty obvious that the whole thing was manufactured to get the kids to face their fears. But, still, things finally moved along, predictable or not, and the lat quarter was probably 2.5 level. But while some things are learned, we're also told that facing your fears is a continuous process - and so the groundwork for the following books in the, I believe, trilogy is laid. I'm not sure I'll be continuing with it, though. ETA: The illustrations go well with the book, in that they are equally lackluster.

17,"I don't quite know how to classify this children's book. It isn't exactly suspense or horror, but somewhere in between. It is very dark, so I wouldn't really recommend it in spite of Sylvia Cassedy's many awards. The heroine becomes entangled in these dolls lives. The dolls actually come to life in the story, but later, when the heroine ""breaks the spell,"" the dolls do not come to life anymore. The heroine has such a horrible living situation, with two nasty aunts and a rather befuddled uncle which helps to make the book even darker.

For instance, after the evil wizard rips the soul-doves out of the young girls' throats (great scene there! )and cooks and eats the bodies, the girls are miraculously returned to life when the wizard is killed.

22,"Again, this book was close to five stars. There were so many times that I was blown away by nostalgia that it was almost ridiculous. The whole time I was reading, I was trying to remember the plot to the movie, so I could guess what was going to happen next (and what was created just for the movie, which was actually quite a bit as it turns out, since they rearranged the plot to mix everything together in the movie and to keep it all in Oz, instead of this new country of Ev). I loved Ev. I love the Wheelers. Tik-Tok is my favourite thing, and Bill(ina, I guess, but that's one of the reasons I couldn't bring myself to give the full five stars--the other being that somehow Dorothy knew that the Tin Woodman's name was Nick Chopper, even though it wasn't even mentioned until the second book, which Dorothy wasn't even in, so how did she know that was his name?!?). The Nome kingdom was something I'm hoping to explore more in future books, and while I like Ozma, I still just really miss Tip  --because even though they're the exact same person, they don't seem anything alike at all, and I thought that was annoying, since Tip was pretty much just awesome. I'm hoping we see the characters of Ev again in the future books, otherwise there were so many characters that were fun, that might be wasted. The princess was definitely different in the book than in the movie (and I think she had a different name, so she might be a mix of two characters in the movie) and I'd like to see more of her.

While reading the book, I was kind of surprised that it got into the plot right away, same as the movie. We weren't introduced that well to Uncle Henry and Aunt Em, but I wish we were so that we could understand better why Dorothy wants to go back to Kansas right away instead of exploring this whole new world that she was thrown into. There were some parts of the book that I found childish, and there are other parts that I found gory such as  the Tin Man's fight with the forty wolves. I found that really brutal. Those poor wolves! And there were forty crows after that. What a waste of birds. I found the Wicked Witch's death way too quick. There was no build up to it, but, oh well. At least it's better than having a house fall on her. I think Oz is a jerk and Dorothy and her friends are extremely gullible or way too forgiving for thinking he's a ""good man but a bad wizard"". I mean, Oz was fine with Dorothy's group getting either enslaved or killed by the Wicked Witch of the West. That is not what a good man would be fine with.

The sweet duck blushingly accepts. On every page, the story gets more intense as the fox has another suggestion leading closer and closer to the end children know is coming. After every question: ""Would you care to boil some water for soup?"" And the duck's innocent answer ""Certainly. I do love soup!"" A Greek chorus of little ducklings appears and warns threateningly:  ""That is NOT a good idea!"" The tension and anxiety builds and builds until finally  The duck, in a shocking twist, agrees with the fox when he suggests there is a 'key ingredient' missing to the soup. ""Oh, a key ingredient IS missing."" she flirtatiously concurs. And on the next page, she's screaming ""YOU!"" as she pushes the fox into the huge boiling soup pot and slams the lid down. The book ends with her and her six little ducklings enjoying their second and third helpings of fox soup. BOOYAH! Children are delighted to no end with this book, it is a certain 5-year-old's favorite - she can even read the whole thing to me all by herself although she sometimes struggles with the word ""ingredient"" and the fox's wording of things. For instance, he says, ""Would you care to go for a stroll?"" And the 5-year-old always seems to think it should be ""Would you like to go for a stroll?"" But she's getting better with every reading, of course. All children are delighted to see this book presented, ESPECIALLY if they think the grown-up reading it to them has never read this book before and doesn't know about the awesome ending. You can see them getting more and more excited as they read it to you, constantly checking your face for reactions and enjoying your anxiety and dismay that the duck is going to be murdered by this charming fox. Then they shriek and exclaim with glee when you get to the end. This book is like the Under the Skin of picture books. The ""innocent female"" who is ""obviously"" going to die (or in Faber's case, get raped) by evil, opportunistic men - is actually the predator and the one whom the ""usual suspect-type predators"" should avoid and fear. The book also has a kind of ""silent film"" theme that children won't pick up on but adults will appreciate, in which a picture is shown and then on the opposite page, a black ""screen"" appears with the dialogue the characters in the picture are supposed to be saying. As always with Mo Willems, a fun, engaging, riotous read that children will not only be very interested in, but will want to read again and again.

28,"Mo LoBeau is a rising sixth-grader in the tiny town of Tupelo Landing, North Carolina. She's a slick talking girl whose best friend is a boy named Dale Earnhardt Johnson III. Mo lives with adoptive parents: Miss Lana, a wig-wearing eccentric cafe owner, and the Colonel, a man with no memory of his past who calls Mo ""soldier"" (affectionately) and hates lawyers. Mo and Dale decide to become detectives when a local man is murdered and the only suspects seem to be Dale and the Colonel. Sheila Turnage's first middle grade novel is exciting, funny, suspenseful, and full of super loveable characters. I can only talk about the flaws in the books by mentioning spoilers, so I won't. Actually, I will here: If Miss Lana knew the Colonel's past all along, why didn't she tell him? Twelve years is a long, long time to keep that kind of thing to yourself. A few notes for future reference: Dale's father is an abusive drunk. Pretty heavy topic for an otherwise mostly lighthearted book. Actually, what's lighthearted about trying to find a murderer? I guess the best way to describe the tone of the book would be heightened realism. There's no magic or anything, but could a baby really wash up in a hurricane? Is any kid as clever and silver tongued as Mo? Would a sheriff (or any grown-up) really let kids get involved in a murder investigation? Mo is always writing her to ""upstream"" mother AKA her biological mother who either abandoned her or lost her. Part of Mo's journey is accepting that she has loving adoptive parents and she doesn't always need to be searching for her ""real"" family. Mo's super crush on Dale's older brother Lavender is completely adorable. She's sure she's going to marry Lavender and he is completely crush worthy. I absolutely adore a quirky and memorable narrator, which Mo totally is. Her voice, which is funny, clever, spunky and full of Southern charm, will stay with me. Read-alike authors (funny, clever, quirky): Frank Cottrell Boyce, Ellen Potter, Jack Gantos, Polly Horvath I loved Mo's voice so much, I went out and got the audiobook, which was fantastic.",4,children,"['mo', 'lobeau', 'rise', 'sixth', 'grader', 'tiny', 'town', 'tupelo', 'landing', 'north', 'carolina', 'slick', 'talk', 'girl', 'good', 'friend', 'boy', 'name', 'dale', 'earnhardt', 'johnson', 'iii', 'mo', 'live', 'adoptive', 'parent', 'miss', 'lana', 'wig', 'wear', 'eccentric', 'cafe', 'owner', 'colonel', 'man', 'memory', 'past', 'call', 'mo', 'soldier', 'affectionately', 'hate', 'lawyer', 'mo', 'dale', 'decide', 'detective', 'local', 'man', 'murder', 'suspect', 'dale', 'colonel', 'sheila', 'turnage', 'middle_grade', 'novel', 'exciting', 'funny', 'suspenseful', 'super', 'loveable', 'character', 'talk', 'flaw', 'book', 'mention', 'spoiler', 'will', 'actually', 'miss', 'lana', 'know', 'colonel', 'past', 'tell', 'year', 'long', 'long', 'time', 'kind', 'thing', 'note', 'future', 'reference', 'dale', 'father', 'abusive', 'drunk', 'pretty', 'heavy', 'topic', 'lighthearted', 'book', 'actually', 'lighthearted', 'try', 'find', 'murderer', 'guess', 'good', 'way', 'describe', 'tone', 'book', 'heighten', 'realism', 'magic', 'baby', 'wash', 'hurricane', 'kid', 'clever', 'silver', 'tongued', 'mo', 'sheriff', 'grown', 'let', 'kid', 'involve', 'murder', 'investigation', 'mo', 'write', 'upstream', 'mother', 'aka', 'biological', 'mother', 'abandon', 'lose', 'mo', 'journey', 'accept', 'love', 'adoptive', 'parent', 'need', 'search', 'real', 'family', 'mo', 'super', 'crush', 'dale', 'old_brother', 'lavender', 'completely', 'adorable', 'sure', 'go', 'marry', 'lavender', 'completely', 'crush', 'worthy', 'absolutely_adore', 'quirky', 'memorable', 'narrator', 'mo', 'totally', 'voice', 'funny', 'clever', 'spunky', 'southern', 'charm', 'stay', 'read', 'alike', 'author', 'funny', 'clever', 'quirky', 'frank', 'cottrell', 'boyce', 'ellen', 'potter', 'jack', 'gantos', 'polly', 'horvath', 'love', 'mo', 'voice', 'go', 'get', 'audiobook', 'fantastic']"
29,"Quick, enjoyable read about a gorilla who has lived in a cage in a mall for most of his life and how he deals with that and with his animal friends who live with him. I enjoyed getting to see the story from Ivan's point of view and the simple but compelling sentences made it easy to get sucked into the story. I loved the differentiation in the way Ivan as a gorilla remembered and in the way Stella, his elephant friend, remembered. It dealt with the important concept of animal abuse and neglect in a interesting, emotionally compelling way without it being too overwhelming for younger audiences. And I loved that the appearance of the baby elephant Ruby finally stirred him to action. Definitely one I'd recommend for juvenile fiction readers and animal lovers in general. Could be a Newbery contender as well, we'll see! Edit: I have to admit that the more I read of children's lit from the past year though, the less excited I am about this one. I think just because it's so simple. I could see it being one that kids really like, it's just missing something for me compared to Wonder and See You at Harry's.",3,children,"['quick', 'enjoyable', 'read', 'gorilla', 'live', 'cage', 'mall', 'life', 'deal', 'animal', 'friend', 'live', 'enjoy', 'get', 'story', 'ivan', 'point_view', 'simple', 'compelling', 'sentence', 'easy', 'suck', 'story', 'love', 'differentiation', 'way', 'ivan', 'gorilla', 'remember', 'way', 'stella', 'elephant', 'friend', 'remember', 'deal', 'important', 'concept', 'animal', 'abuse', 'neglect', 'interesting', 'emotionally', 'compelling', 'way', 'overwhelming', 'young', 'audience', 'love', 'appearance', 'baby', 'elephant', 'ruby', 'finally', 'stir', 'action', 'definitely_recommend', 'juvenile', 'fiction', 'reader', 'animal', 'lover', 'general', 'newbery', 'contender', 'edit', 'admit', 'read', 'child', 'lit', 'past', 'year', 'excited', 'think', 'simple', 'kid', 'like', 'miss', 'compare', 'wonder', 'harry']"

32,"Having been a huge fan of A Series of Unfortunate Events (seriously; I even did a re-read and re-blog event on my tumblr), I finally decided I had to get my hands on the first book in his latest series, ""All The Wrong Questions,"" which focuses on Lemony Snicket's childhood/induction into a mysterious organization that ASOUE readers will know is VFD . It's set to be a four book series and the first is Who Could That Be at This Hour? We meet young Snicket is mysterious circumstances, of course, as he's meeting up with the woman he's to apprentice after graduation. It's obvious Snicket hasn't had the traditional education, because he's ""almost thirteen"" when he graduates and goes with his chaperone to a seaside town that's no longer by the seaside to retrieve a stolen item that probably wasn't stolen. He meets some strange characters here, including a girl with a missing father and a young reporter without a newspaper. Discussing the plot of this would be pointless because honestly, you just have to read it and find out for yourself. But I will say that although this is obviously different from ASOUE (different characters, mysteries, etc.) and Snicket has said it's sort of noir for middle grade, there's still the trademark Snicket characteristics here. Word definitions, odd segues, things that are never quite what they seem. I definitely recommend this book if you're a Snicket fan or like odd little books, but readers not acquainted with Snicket's style (or who didn't enjoy ASOUE) might be disappointed and/or confused by this one.",3,children,"['having', 'huge_fan', 'series', 'unfortunate', 'events', 'seriously', 'read', 'blog', 'event', 'tumblr', 'finally', 'decide', 'hand', 'book', 'late', 'series', 'wrong', 'question', 'focus', 'lemony', 'snicket', 'childhood', 'induction', 'mysterious', 'organization', 'asoue', 'reader', 'know', 'vfd', 'set', 'book', 'series', 'hour', 'meet', 'young', 'snicket', 'mysterious', 'circumstance', 'course', 'meet', 'woman', 'apprentice', 'graduation', 'obvious', 'snicket', 'traditional', 'education', 'thirteen', 'graduate', 'go', 'chaperone', 'seaside', 'town', 'long', 'seaside', 'retrieve', 'steal', 'item', 'probably', 'steal', 'meet', 'strange', 'character', 'include', 'girl', 'miss', 'father', 'young', 'reporter', 'newspaper', 'discuss', 'plot', 'pointless', 'honestly', 'read', 'find', 'obviously', 'different', 'asoue', 'different', 'character', 'mystery', 'etc', 'snicket', 'say', 'sort', 'noir', 'middle_grade', 'trademark', 'snicket', 'characteristic', 'word', 'definition', 'odd', 'segue', 'thing', 'definitely_recommend', 'book', 'snicket', 'fan', 'like', 'odd', 'little', 'book', 'reader', 'acquaint', 'snicket', 'style', 'enjoy', 'asoue', 'disappoint', 'confuse']"

Was she really being selfish and just choosing herself? I LOVE how much she loved Ess, but sometimes truly loving someone is making tough choices when it comes to that person. Maybe Jinny just didn't have the emotional maturity to make those choices? And did Jinny REALLY break the island or was it all one, big, massive coincidence? Obviously, Jinny bleeding is her getting her period for the first time, but everything else? What could all that be!? At first the characters were a blur--there's nine orphans so it took me a few chapters to sort them out--but they quickly became distinct, though some of them don't have much page time.

35,"Humans waste words. They toss them like banana peels and leave them to rot. This book ruined me just a little bit. The great thing about children's books is that the authors focus on the characters and story more than trying to write beautifully and complexly, and as a result the simple reading level doesn't even matter. In this case, the story was told from the point of view of a gorilla named Ivan, so the easy language is actually beautiful. Adults and 12-year-olds could relate to him to the same degree because he isn't human, but sometimes reminds you of one. Ivan is based off of a real gorilla who was captured as a baby and who lived in a circus for 27 years away from other gorillas before  being transferred to a zoo  . The innocence of animal voices in any books from their perspective makes me sad. Reading something from the point of view of a gorilla who doesn't mind captivity so much but still has a sense of something greater out there just makes me cry.

36,"It's a fun retelling - young girls will like the feisty nature of the heroine and identify with 12 year old Rapunzel's woes, but it feels cobbled together. Prince Benjamin's story feels even more so (though he seems like a nice kid, for a prince). Likely this is not going to bother a 12 year old reader the way it bothered me, so (unless you want to read spoilers) we'll leave it at: fun story, feisty heroine, nice prince, cute pet cat. While she kicks herself for not having thought of it (and so she should) ... you didn't think of your hair...really? You solved those other mysteries with no probs, Goldie! Why the blonde moment now? Two humans just climbed it! You could have gone either direction - chop it off and climb down it, or tie it and climb down it and chop it off at the bottom. But no, send the prince home to steal silk from his mother to make a rope. She's going to love you. I can tell. Fight a troll with tomatoes? Well, to be fair, this is the kind of goony theory a 12 year old might fall for... I want to see giant scary thorn bushes that you can throw a cloak over and then slide down from the top. Slide! What's that cloak made of? Magic tarp? Ouch! So, we skip forward to the party at the end: the prince is still engaged to a girl from another kingdom, I take it - I mean, why wouldn't he be. Are his parents going to let him marry this - while pretty - peasant he just rescued? At 12 years old? No, young man, I think not. Your little friend seems like a sweet girl, but she must go home to her hovel.

37,"It takes an animal to show you what animals human beings can be. Perhaps the worst trait in this book is to be human, the exception of course being Thornton. The book deals with the idea of taming the wild and is told from a dog's perspective. This perspective is Buck, a cross between a St.Bernard and a Scotch Shepherd - a leader amongst dogs. Buck had always been a tameable creature, and when the deceitful employee of his owner steals him and sells him off, Buck starts to go wild. From sunny California, Buck becomes an Alaskan sled dog. The majority of the book deals with Buck becoming wilder and wilder. He is taking in the far north, mostly on postal routes around Yukon. It isn't until Thornton (a man who saves him from his cruel owners) takes him in that Buck learns true love. When Thornton his friends and Buck go off east of Klondike in search of gold buck starts to hear the call of the wild. It isn't long before Buck turns completely wild and goes off for days from his master on wild adventures. But the love for his master always brings him back. One fateful day when Buck returns from one of his wild adventures he discovers that his master has been killed by Indians, it is then that he becomes a free wild animal. The bond between human and man forever broken. Buck then becomes accepted by a pack of wolves as their leader. He lives a prosperous life and continues to terrorise the Indians. The question then to ask is does Buck stand for anything more than our oppressive hold on animals? I think not. But, there could be some underlying connections there with post-colonialism and the taming of the wild and the 'savages' who inhabit such places.

38,"Hokey Pokey: a dreamscape populated entirely by children, from diaper-clad Newbies to Big Kids. A place where the sun always shines, and herds of wild bicycles roam the plains. A place where a giant screen plays classic cartoons all day long. A place where children drop off to sleep while their monsters gleam above them. A place where boys and girls are divided into separate camps, as unknowable to each other as different species. A place with train tracks but no train and an island with a hut that no one can enter. Hokey Pokey is all Jack has ever known, roaming with his Amigos on their bicycles, playing catch with little Kiki, endlessly battling the girl named Jubilee. But something is changing. He is not himself. And he is not sure what that means. I have mixed feelings about this book. The writing is beautiful, smooth and dreamy. Hokey Pokey is clearly a magical place, separate from the real world, but it has an internal consistency. Well, mostly. The trouble comes when that consistency breaks down. It's even more confusing in the final chapters, when the reader sees Jack in ""the real world"". We see Kiki, Lopez, and Jubilee, too. When I closed the book, I was just left with questions with no satisfying answers, like: Why does Jubilee have a brother in Hokey Pokey when no one else does? How is it that none of the kids have never noticed anyone else leaving? Since the catcher's mitt is evidently real, does that mean Jack's bike was also really stolen by Jubilee? What, exactly, was the point of this book? I'm left wondering what the point of the book was because very little happens. While this is clearly a book about childhood - with the feel of an elegy for a type of childhood that no longer exists in this digital age - it does not really seem like a book for children. Which leaves me in that uncomfortable spot of appreciating the craft that went into the book, but unsure who the intended audience is.",2,children,"['hokey_pokey', 'dreamscape', 'populate', 'entirely', 'child', 'diaper', 'clothe', 'newbie', 'big', 'kids', 'place', 'sun', 'shine', 'herd', 'wild', 'bicycle', 'roam', 'plain', 'place', 'giant', 'screen', 'play', 'classic', 'cartoon', 'day', 'long', 'place', 'child', 'drop', 'sleep', 'monster', 'gleam', 'place', 'boy', 'girl', 'divide', 'separate', 'camp', 'unknowable', 'different', 'specie', 'place', 'train', 'track', 'train', 'island', 'hut', 'enter', 'hokey_pokey', 'jack', 'know', 'roam', 'amigos', 'bicycle', 'play', 'catch', 'little', 'kiki', 'endlessly', 'battle', 'girl', 'name', 'jubilee', 'change', 'sure', 'mean', 'mixed_feeling', 'book', 'writing', 'beautiful', 'smooth', 'dreamy', 'hokey_pokey', 'clearly', 'magical', 'place', 'separate', 'real', 'world', 'internal', 'consistency', 'trouble', 'come', 'consistency', 'break', 'confusing', 'final', 'chapter', 'reader', 'see', 'jack', 'real', 'world', 'kiki', 'lopez', 'jubilee', 'close', 'book', 'leave', 'question', 'satisfying', 'answer', 'like', 'jubilee', 'brother', 'hokey_pokey', 'kid', 'notice', 'leave', 'catcher', 'mitt', 'evidently', 'real', 'mean', 'jack', 'bike', 'steal', 'jubilee', 'exactly', 'point', 'book', 'leave', 'wonder', 'point', 'book', 'little', 'happen', 'clearly', 'book', 'childhood', 'feel', 'elegy', 'type', 'childhood', 'long', 'exist', 'digital', 'age', 'like', 'book', 'child', 'leave', 'uncomfortable', 'spot', 'appreciate', 'craft', 'go', 'book', 'unsure', 'intend', 'audience']"

43,"Ward won the Caldecott for the detailed, sepia-toned, drawings that accompany this story. Johnny Orchard lives on a farm at the far end of the valley, near a big woods. Whenever he walks down the road he notices that other barns have bear skins drying on their walls; he's embarrassed that his family's barn doesn't have a bear skin. So he heads into the woods one day, with his rifle, determined to get the biggest bear. What he finds, though is an orphaned bear cub, which he befriends with a piece of maple sugar candy. But when he brings the cub home, problems begin; and they only get worse when the bear grows B*I*G. I think children might be intrigued by the adventure of the story, but I hope they wouldn't feel encouraged to try to tame a wild animal. I was also somewhat dismayed by a scene where Johnny has to take his bear to the woods to kill it because it has become a nuisance. Don't worry, he doesn't ever actually do this, but he has every intention of doing so,   and I find that disturbing in a children's book. The illustrations are wonderfully detailed.

45,"Okay, yeah. The books that teachers assign for homework suck. (I mean, most of the ones that I've been assigned.) Most of them are boring. They also include homework and they also come with that very strictly-graded essay that you have to write and type once you finish the book (so even when you've closed the book...THE TORTURE IS NOT OVER YET!). You have to read the freaking thing EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. And it's torture. (What do you expect from homework.) And yes, this book was assigned to us in my 7th grade reading class. And I thought it was going to be boring to read.....BUT I LOVED IT. And so did the rest of the class. This was about 3 years ago. I've been through English classes and quite a few classic homework-assigned books already. I've heard my class's opinions. ""This is so boring."" ""There's a lot of homework for this."" ""I had to read over the last chapter because I didn't understand it."" ""When are we going to move on to another book?"" I remember when my (very weird and crazy) reading teacher introduced this book to us. I probably didn't think it was all that exciting when I saw it. He said, ""Oooooh, see the really creepy looking cover with that really creepy and depressed looking dude's face creeping out of a tree?"" Sure, the cover was pretty creepy, but after the first few chapters, the comments that this book got were: ""This is a pretty good book!"" ""This is interesting."" ""Can we read Among the Hidden today?"" ""Are we reading the next book?"" ""Is our next book going to be as good as Among the Hidden?"" This is by far my FAVORITE BOOK that I've ever had to read in my English/Reading classes. I. LOVED. THIS. BOOK. It made me love my homework for once. (And like any other sane child, I did not like homework at all.) I ended up going to the library and checking this book out and finishing the book a couple of weeks early before the essay we had to write was due. IT WAS JUST SO AWESOME. I haven't read this book in 3 years, but I remember it! It was about Luke (forgot his last time) who lived in a world where no family was allowed more than 2 children. And Luke was the third child. So he was hidden, and he wasn't allowed to go outside, and he couldn't do any of the things that his two older brothers did. Actually, in World Geography in 8th grade, we learned that China is a little bit like this. Except families are only allowed ONE child (because the population is so huge and there's not enough room or food for all those people). Most of the people wanted boys because when the boy grew up and got married, he'd be able to continue the family name. When GIRLS got married, they'd have to leave the family and change their name, and their family's name would forever cease to exist. So everyone wanted a son. Daughters would be given to orphanages and stuff. BUT GIRLS ARE SO MUCH MORE AWESOMER THAN GUYS. (Yeah, just a.....fun fact.) Anyway, he meets Jen, another third child that had moved into one of the new houses that were built near theirs. And Jen was teaming up with a bunch of other hidden children to fight against the government. This book includes suspense. That's just why I loved this book. SUSPENSEFUL SUSPENSE! That's what kept me reading! I didn't want to have to wait for reading class to read this book! The big spoiler is this book has a sad ending . I never got a chance to read the second installment of this series but I really should!

The world building was excellent, and I could understand and imagine the hows and whys for most of the story. A few things didn't add up for me  such as why/how they can't see colours, how they climate control everything despite Jonas being able to travel outside and encounter things such as hills and weather again, or how the memories are given/received  . I also found the characters quite flat, which makes sense in relation to the world, and helps add a feeling of creepiness and something being amiss. The end also frustrated me, I assume we are supposed to imagine what the actual ending is, and it seems as though Jonas has probably died in a happy memory, and it is all a big metaphor for being free and happy than safe but unfeeling, but I still felt a little cheated, I wanted to know what happened for certain . Jonas was a good enough protagonist, and the story was interesting, and I really enjoyed the ideas bought up in the book, but it just didn't quite work for me, though I think this would have had a bigger effect on me as a younger reader, which of course is the age it is intended for.

55,"I got an ARC of this book from Book Expo America. This is a companion book to Wonder, and it's really three short stories/novellas from the perspective of different characters in the book. The first is Julian's Chapter, and I was really hesitant about this because it felt like it could go horribly wrong to do a ""from the bully's perspective"" sort of thing. It could just be too cheesy to show that the bully was abused or something and that's why he picked on kids, etc. But it wasn't like that. Yes, in some ways the story ""redeems"" Julian, but it really felt like more of a realistic perspective. He's always had horrible nightmares about deformed people/monsters. And his mother does what she does because she can't stand to see her child hurting. It doesn't make either of them right, but it does explain some things. And in the end Julian does come around. The next story was Pluto, and it's from Christopher's perspective - the boy who August had been friends with growing up. This was probably my least favorite of the three stories, but it was still good. Christopher got on my nerves a bit because he's clearly entering that annoying pre-teen phase - doing things like calling his mother by her first name and just being generally rude. The ending felt a bit cliche, but all in all it was a fine read. The final story, Shingaing, was probably my favorite. It's from Charlotte's point of view, whom we see briefly in Wonder. She has plenty to deal with outside of August. It's nothing super crazy, but shows a lot of the typical middle school drama. It's very well written and realistic - at least realistic to my own middle school years 15 years ago. I remember that girl drama all too well, and Palacio captures it here. While the story itself wasn't wildly special, I thought Charlotte was a really cool character and that's what made me enjoy it so much. In some ways she's a typical middle school girl, but in others she's different - she's nice to (almost) everyone, hard working and dedicated, and into musicals and dancing.

56,"Have you ever seen a hastily made cash-grab sequel? They are often straight to dvd, have an entirely new cast, and although they seem like a carbon copy of the original characters and plot, they are devoid of the heart and creativity that made the original special.

The story does not pick up where the first one ends, I guess those fictional characters were busy on other projects or where outside the production budget. Instead, the two main characters Proloff and his bald chick are simply referenced with the added bonus of a sound bite that was probably edited together from the first book. The story was confusing, unnecessary, and completely unbelievable. In true Hollywood fashion, there was less substance and more explosions. we don't need logic we have BOOM! The characters followed the same formula, with our bad ass male protagonist and his privileged love interest who is pretty much a non-entity. There are the obligatory baddies who deceive the poor just for the fun of it, The TV host is a puppet? Why? If you were trying to be shocking or clever you failed, it was not at all surprising, just stupid. Why would they go through the trouble of creating a puppet TV host? and rich people who chomp down on caviar while chilling in first class. What really didn't make sense to me was that this story followed a completely different train also known as the Snowpiercer. Snowpiercer 1 didn't know about 2 but they were on the same track for like over a decade? What!? This isn't making any sense! Half of this didn't make sense the other half was too boring to care about it making sense. There might have been something lost in translation but mostly this was just stupid.

57,"Another one-shot released in the Locke & Key universe. The grindhouse story is a depression era story of three gangsters stumbling on Keyhouse. It is a brutal tale with some unflinching language and violence. Joe makes you hate the villains immediately. As always in this series, its all about the keys! The reader is always clamoring for new keys, and that is where this story falls short. The ""Bitey"" Key is used in this story but no explanation is given. I think its only previous appearance is in the drawing Bode did in the ""Guide to the Known Keys"". No backstory on the key is given. Nor any explanation of how Bode knew about it. All in all a fun story, but it doesn't add a whole lot to the mythos. Also included is the Guide to Keyhouse. Joe in an introduction makes it clear that the detail provided here is all about Gabe. I had no idea so much detail and care had gone into the architecture of the house. This is a fascinating look at the creation of one of the main characters in the series.

63,"Story: 4 stars Art: 5 stars Fish Girl is a middle grade graphic novel about a mermaid who is held captive in a boardwalk sideshow by the owner, a former fisherman who impersonates Neptune the King of the Seas to entertain paying audiences. But Fish Girl is the main attraction of the aquarium, and she believes her captor really is Neptune the God. At least at first. But Fish Girl is clever and observant in her search for truth, freedom, and humanity. She has help along the way by an octopus, who has been her loyal companion since she was a baby, as well as a new female human friend and a magical ocean. Spectacular full-color art. While Neptune is a manipulative and creepy adult male who is imprisoning a young girl, the fantasy elements make this story a gentle way to introduce this seedier, tragic aspect of life to middle grade readers. The loving friendship between Fish Girl and Octopus is heartwarming and palpable, despite the fact that neither can speak. I just wish the ending was more conclusive, given the targeted age group and all that Fish Girl has endured. While Fish Girl clearly breaks free of her bondage, where will she go now and how will she survive?

64,"Dan Slott has been tearing up the track with Superior Spider-Man since issue 1. Superior Spider-Man: Necessary Evil is the first pit stop this title has taken since the start. Slott, Stegman, and Camuncoli still deliver a first-rate collection with Volume 4, but it is probably my least favorite so far. Spider-Man 2099 makes a guest appearance and has a run in with Spidey. Otto doesn't have the have the advantage of Peter's memories after deleting him from his brain in the last trade, so he doesn't remember meeting future Spidey before. This, of course, leads to dueling wall-crawlers. This is probably the part of the collection I was least impressed with. Personally, just not that interested in 2099 as a character. Watching Otto squirm while dealing with Pete's day to day was still fun though. Spider-Man's next run in is with the Black Cat. Not the typical game of cat and mouse that these two usually play. Man, I would not want to be Peter when he gets his body back. He'll be lucky to get off with a kick in the nuts. And the soap opera doesn't end there. MJ tries to get back in the dating pool, one of Otto's old flames comes looking for a little pay back from our friendly neighbor widow-maker, and Otto continues to get a taste of what it was like for the original when he has some problems at school. Green Goblin, who is calling himself the Goblin King nowadays, continues to resurface from time to time. No doubt preparing for what is going to be a hell of a showdown with Spidey sometime soon. And I gotta admit, I'm interested as to who's wearing Goblin's mask. Is that you under there Normie? The art is as consistent as ever. I missed Ramos, but Stegman and Camuncoli both do impressive jobs.

65,"Usually, I'd try to find something to compare to this because it's a comic book instead of a novel and it's a modern Marvel instead of a vintage DC--but, honestly, I can't think of anything to compare this one to. Normally, that would be a good thing meaning it's creative and well-written, but it just didn't hit the right tune this time. I was first introduced to both Moonknight and Brian Michael Bendis in Bendis' Ultimate Spiderman Volumes in 2005. It was when ""ultimate"" was the hit word for Marvel and several of their characters were being rewritten to a modern flavor. It was smooth, engaging story-writing that, sadly, I'm having a hard time finding in comic books currently being written today (Deadpool: Suicide Kings and Batman: Noel are good examples of lazy comic book writing--sorry guys). The flavor of this Moonknight volume is definitely Bendis. The characters are realistic but funny in a dry sense. They aren't overly poetic like Alan Moore and I like that. Nice twist. Last time I saw Moonknight in Spiderman he had a little girl and a violent man as his personalities. That's why I was surprised with the Spiderman, Captain America, and Wolverine personalities :D . However, these characters didn't stick for me. I felt disconnected from them. Yes, this is a comic book not a book-book where we have the freedom of being in the protagonist's head. I'm not stupid, I understand that. Part of it could be that we don't sympathize with Marc Spektor. Because he's friends with his split personalities, he isn't in any danger, so there's nothing to be concerned about. I'm sure if I give it some space and then pick it up again later, I'll like it more the second time around.

In Fish Girl we see the bonds of friendship - with Mira and Octopus and her new human friend, we see Mira discover the truth, and begin to explore the world around her and begin to make her own choices. The ending was a little abrupt (since I don't know what's going to happen with her now, given her circumstances) but I'll just call it an open ending and say they left it up to us to imagine what would happen next. I think more could've been done in terms of the actual story, but the art was lovely and well worth reading just for that.

68,"Dear Fables: welcome back! When the war against the Adversary ended and we caught we first few glimpses of Mr. Dark, I was excited about the new directions Bill Willingham was taking this series.

So Winter is the first child, Therese the third, Darien the fourth and Ambrose probably the seventh, from what we see in that last story. Therese's journey was absolutely creepy (the tale of why the toys were sent to Discardia was especially hard to read, as was Therese's journey into the dark side), but it's Darien's story, the hommage to ""The Fisher King"" myths that really grabs your attention. Since I had never heard of that myth, I had to google it and then re-read the story to get the full impact, and that's when it really hits you. He was truly the leader of the pack.

70,"""Someone was screaming, high and terrible... like a cloud passing before the sun... against the bleak grey sky swayed a tall tall prince in black armor with only half a skull."" Yes, I admit, the first time I saw the book in the bookstore I screamed in my head 'stop writing these stories and please finish The Winds of Winter!' However, my pain for the original books aside, this is a really good story, I really enjoyed it! And to be fair, this appeared as a novella c.2005, so it's not really a new story. Set about a hundred years before the original series, the story follows Dunk, a hedge knight (a knight without a Lord), and Egg, also known as Aegon - one of the Tagaryen Princes who later ascends the Iron Throne. He's also the Egg that Maester Aemon used to talk about! And I've just realized that he is also Jon's great-great grandfather! At least in the books, in the TV Show I think they skipped a generation and he's just Jon's great grandfather. The plot itself is strong enough, but that's not really why I loved the story so much. I loved the story because of the lore and history that it gives us about the Seven Kingdoms and in particular on the Tagaryen family. They're my favourite house, some my favourite characters are Tagaryens, and they have such an interesting history and relationships with one another. I also enjoyed that the characters were all thought out and established. It also made me realized that, although he has his shortcomings, GRRM is a good writer. This particularly stood out to me as I am watching the TV Show at the moment, and the more they move away from the source material, the more clear it becomes that for the most part the writing is lacking, and that the greatness was in GRRM's story and words. Egg stole the story for me, but I expected that from what I heard and knew of the character and his life. We meet him as a child, for whom the Iron Throne is even further than a far away dream because he is the fourth son of the ruling king's fourth son. Can't get further on the line of succession, and yet it's great to read his story and realize that this hot-headed young prince eventually become King Aegon V! And Dunk is pretty great too; he clearly has a set standard of morals that he refuses to break, and he's a really good knight that protects those in need. And again, so interesting to see how this hedge knight would eventually become Lord Commander of the Knigsguard when Aegon takes the throne.

71,"So it's the end of an era. I was mildly disappointed that we didn't get to see a ginormous battle  but with only one volume left, I don't see how they could have done that justice so perhaps it's best this way. There's quite a bit of closure so if you like that stuff (e.g. Me! ), you should be happy.

72,"Hulk gets shuttled off planet Earth because ... well, apparently the Hulk has no friends on Earth anymore. * They all suck, particularly Reed Richards (ha, like that's a secret). But the Hulk lands not where he was supposed to - instead he lands on Sakaar, a planet with a prophecy that a figure called Sakaarson will come to save and unite the people (multiple actors here - pink humanoids, bug creatures, shadow-people silver humanoids, etc). It gets very Dune-esque from therein. Like any good epic, the Hulk goes through multiple trials on said planet to eventually defeat the Red King ... who clearly deserved it because he's a dick with little regard for life. In the first Gladiator-esque challenge, Hulk makes fraaaands with Miek (bug), Korg (Kronan - love those rockheads), Elloe (pinkie), Hiroim (shadow person), Brood (bug). Oh, and the Silver Surfer makes a brief appearance, is freed, does from freeing. You know, surfs, too. It's forgettable. By the end, Hulk eventually even marries Caiera (the Oldstrong Shadow first serving the Red King) when he becomes the king/emperor. But then Mr. Fantastic's ship fucks everything up for the poor Hulk; the warp core explores and kills his new alien lady love/empress. Back to square zero, I guess. Thoughts/questions in no particular order: 1) Did Miek just level up like a Pokemon? Weedle-to-Beedrill? 2) This run has both the Maw (several mentions) and threshers (one mention) ... seeing something in that. Also, the creature Hulk frees ... totally a overgrown varren. 3) Why the hell does Caiera there only start calling Hulk ""Holku"" in the last few issues, to verbalize endearment...? Meh. 4) What's that last reference in #105, ""The Eye of Anger. The World Breaker. Harkanon. Haarg."" ... that a Dune reference? Looks like Harkonnen to me. I doubt it, but I seriously don't understand the last epitaph in this run. Haaalp? Last thought: Who was narrating this entire series? A mystical voice on high? *Cho. I know. I get it.

I really enjoyed reading about his origins to becoming the best Batman villain of all. Alan Moore's writing is fantastic and the artwork was great. I'll be reading this one again. The Joker shoots Barbara Gordon, paralyzing her from the waist down and takes pictures of her, stripped down and half-dead. He kidnaps Commissioner Gordon and takes him to a freaky carnival, chaining him up completely naked and forcing him to look at pictures of what he's done to his daughter. He does everything he can to drive Commissioner Gordon insane, seeing how much he can endure. Batman realizes that the only way for his relationship with the Joker to end is in death... one way or another, one of them are going to have to die at the others hand.

75,"Fear the Hunters wasn't my favourite volume of The Walking Dead, but the fact I knew about the major moments beforehand really served to lessen their impact. I must try harder to keep away from Wikipedia, but it's to Kirkman's credit that I'm so damn anxious about the survivors that I need to check up on what's ahead for them. I think this volume's biggest problem for me was plausibility and emotional resonance. And I know, I know it's set in the zombie apocalypse so griping about realism is silly, but I'm going to do a little of it anyway. As Kirkman acknowledges in the letters pages, the twins have hardly even spoken throughout this series. We see them in the background stood with Andrea and Dale quite often, fair enough, but we never really see any bonding between them as a family unit. So when one murders the other and is in turn killed by Carl, it's hard for me to buy Dale and Andrea's grief. Her heartbreak over Dale's death felt believable, natural and appropriate, but it's hard to envision her as a bereaved mother, because she's never really been depicted as a mom. So there's that, and then you add in the cannibals... it's not something I really bought in McCarthy's The Road either, though Kirkman almost had me with the group's explanation for their actions. It's just really hard to imagine that so much food has been looted they need to eat their own kids.

The Moment when they finally reach their house, after encountering grave difficulties, only to watch a plane crashing into it (while beeing the only house for miles and miles) It could have been a welcome punchline in a totally different story - it just didn't fit too well in this one. The second part, that was a bit stressed in my book was  the point when Shunka goes on his rampage - the motivation for that comes a little bit out of nowhere to me. Still the story centered on Shunka is a pretty good and enjoyable one. Especially the element of the gay-indian-issue is very well done. While my problem with this one is the slightest in this book, the one in the main storyline is my biggest. It really made me going ""Aw cmon, don't start getting cheap on me when  Dash shook his drug-addiction in a way like those characters in other stories who travel to Japan, only to come back as full-fledged ninjas after two weeks or so So maybe this sounds a little overly critic and gives the impression that Vol 7 is not a enjoyable book.

78,"""So much was destroyed during the war. And yet some cities rebuilt themselves...as if nothing happened. Too bad people don't rebuild themselves that easily."" True rating:4 1/2 stars I've only read a couple of stand alone graphic novels but had a desire to start reading more graphic novel series. The obvious starting point seemed to be Saga, Volume 1 but that one has so much hype around it I didn't feel up to it. Monstress is a wonderful place to start if you want to get into graphic novels. +1 star for the plot. The story unfolds in a beautifully crafted way that is wonderfully formatted and has a pace that keeps you interested but not overwhelmed and it all takes place in a world that was well built by the author. +1 star for the characters  I felt immediately drawn to the characters of this story. The ""good guys"" had me caring from the start and the ""bad guys"" had me intrigued the entire way through. In spite of this though I never felt like I had the characters all figured out, which to me is wonderful because it means the author has created strong characters without making them walking tropes. +1 1/2 star for the artwork  As much as I love the story of Monstress I would honestly buy this graphic novel for just the art itself. Its so stunning and different from other art styles I've seen. It's a wonderful mix of eastern and western art that really made me even more captivated in the world of the graphic novel. -1/2 star for some lack of explanation  It honestly may be an issue on my part but it took me a lot of the book to keep track of the terminology used to describe the different species living in the world so I wish it was said clearly what each species was and did. Also the whole limb thing was unclear to me. Why eat just the limbs and not the whole bodies   However, I do see myself rereading the beginning of the first half of the book and probably gaining a better understanding which will boost my rating to 5 stars. In conclusion, I'm so happy to be getting into graphic novels now and will definitely be continuing in this beautiful series.

This particular entry in the series was not my favourite. Don't get me wrong, I thoroughly enjoyed it, but not only is it the end of a great thing, but it wasn't the strongest end I could've foreseen. It felt a little bit rushed, like perhaps they reached the climax of the series and suddenly decided, ""Ok, now let's end it."" The evil plot reveal was for instance, solid, but not that big a twist. The whole novel was quick, brutal, and irrevocable. My only artistic complaint is that, although I really liked how the ghost-talk was misty and difficult to read, I really wish it were just a bit more legible. And perhaps this was just my copy, but.. as the story progressed I was able to read less and less, until the last ghost scene where I wondered why it was even written at all if I couldn't read even a single word of it.

85,"This is a fantastic example of how a graphic novel can be an extremely powerful method of telling a story. Bechdel's illustrations are rather straightforward, but the juxtaposition of her illustrations to the words just hit me in the gut at times. It really hurt to read some of the passages, and I ached for that little girl and the young girl. I read her literary references as her attempts to try to make sense of what was going on in her life - and in her father's/family's life/lives. I don't think there is any pretention about the literary references (as some reviewers seem to think). She has the background. It's part of her life. I picked up this book after reading an article (I think it was in The Guardian) about graphic novels one should read. Books without illustrations can move me. This is one with illustrations that really moved me. The very last frame and its build-up choked me up and brought out some tears. The depth of the clear language and the straightforward illustrations is what makes the book amazing for me and what earns my five stars.",5,comic,"['fantastic', 'example', 'graphic_novel', 'extremely', 'powerful', 'method', 'tell', 'story', 'bechdel', 'illustration', 'straightforward', 'juxtaposition', 'illustration', 'word', 'hit', 'gut', 'time', 'hurt', 'read', 'passage', 'ache', 'little', 'girl', 'young', 'girl', 'read', 'literary_reference', 'attempt', 'try', 'sense', 'go', 'life', 'family', 'life', 'life', 'think', 'pretention', 'literary_reference', 'reviewer', 'think', 'background', 'life', 'pick', 'book', 'read', 'article', 'think', 'guardian', 'graphic_novel', 'read', 'book', 'illustration', 'illustration', 'move', 'frame', 'build', 'choke', 'bring', 'tear', 'depth', 'clear', 'language', 'straightforward', 'illustration', 'make', 'book', 'amazing', 'earn', 'star']"

87,"Volume two of Saga picks up right from where the first volume ended with Marko's parents making the surprising introduction of Alana and Hazel and not taking it well at all. They're clearly thrown off by the off match and not friendly to Alana at all but she can throw it straight back at them. When they've finally established a little peace they decide to travel to meet the author of the couple's favourite book and introduce Hazel to the great man. On the other side, The Will and Prince IV are still searching for the abnormal family but The Will has an unwelcome partner pushing him along to find Marko and get revenge. The Will and Prince IV are both deeply troubled by their past and they're unstable most of the time. Then there's little Slave Girl, saved by The Will, with an odd gift of feeling items of power and speaking to them. This volume was an excellent sequel to the first one and it was all over far too quickly. Luckily I just so happened to get the third volume come in today because I was going through a major withdrawal after I finished this one. The illustrations were fantastically detailed again with so much colour and attention to detail and the writing was brilliant but filled with anguish for the reader. All I know now is that I need to read volume four because yes, I've already finished volume three! Favourite Quotes... - ""So glad I got to do this in a towel."" - ""This is the best book I've ever read."" - ""I was giving Hazel a bath and part of her just fucking fell off."" *Spoilers Below* It was sad to learn that Barr was dying because I really pictured them as a happy family exploring the galaxy but I've learned by now that Saga is anything but idealistic. It is mean, sad and heartbreaking! But I wouldn't have it any other way. I still think it was a complete shame to have him die so quickly but it did make me much more sympathetic to him and really focus on the little moments he was in the comic. One of the best things that happened was all the awesome clothes he made them and the adorable ones he made Hazel! It makes me so sad to think of them wearing them and growing out of them over the years and losing the last piece of him! It also softened Marko's mother and allowed Alana and her to bond in a small way. The meeting between Alana and Marko was odd and exactly how you think it would go with them meeting in a jail cell and her taking the phrase ""hitting it off"" to a new level. I hope there is a few more flashbacks in the series, maybe their wedding! It was a great scene when she was reading him the book before they decided to run away. Marko saying, ""Please. Keep reading"" should be on a poster on everyone's wall. I think Alana's love for her book is so, so similar to every reader of this series and it's also an excellent way to bond with her character more as she yells NO SPOILERS! It also leads them to the author of that book and we learn that it's not just a silly book but a book with real opinions about war and a hope for love. I would totally read this book about a couple that hangs out and play board games but also sometimes eat sandwiches at the movies! Then enters Gwendolyn, we remember her from volume one as the ex-fiance of Marko and the woman he stole their wedding rings off. It doesn't exactly sound like she'll be giving him hugs when she finds him and with the help of The Will she will find him. Prince IV also makes an appearance where he interrogated the author and basically tells him to kill him. He's clearly suffering deeply from his time in the war and is still having some dark reactions displayed prominently on his face-screen. We still don't know a whole lot about him so I'm hoping his story unfolds more. Also, I again was completely in love with every page with little Hazel on it. She is just the most adorable little girl and it was so hilarious with Alana thought she broke her when her umbilical cord came off! I hope she stays adorable forever but I really want to see what she looks like all grown up!",5,comic,"['volume', 'saga', 'pick', 'right', 'volume', 'end', 'marko', 'parent', 'make', 'surprising', 'introduction', 'alana', 'hazel', 'take', 'clearly', 'throw', 'match', 'friendly', 'alana', 'throw', 'straight', 'finally', 'establish', 'little', 'peace', 'decide', 'travel', 'meet', 'author', 'couple', 'favourite', 'book', 'introduce', 'hazel', 'great', 'man', 'prince_iv', 'search', 'abnormal', 'family', 'unwelcome', 'partner', 'push', 'find', 'marko', 'revenge', 'prince_iv', 'deeply', 'trouble', 'past', 'unstable', 'time', 'little', 'slave', 'girl', 'save', 'odd', 'gift', 'feel', 'item', 'power', 'speak', 'volume', 'excellent', 'sequel', 'far', 'quickly', 'luckily', 'happen', 'volume', 'come', 'today', 'go', 'major', 'withdrawal', 'finish', 'illustration', 'fantastically', 'detailed', 'colour', 'attention', 'detail', 'writing', 'brilliant', 'fill', 'anguish', 'reader', 'know', 'need', 'read', 'volume', 'yes', 'finish', 'volume', 'favourite', 'quote', 'glad', 'get', 'towel', 'good', 'book', 'read', 'give', 'hazel', 'bath', 'fucking', 'fall', 'spoiler', 'sad', 'learn', 'barr', 'die', 'picture', 'happy', 'family', 'explore', 'galaxy', 'learn', 'saga', 'idealistic', 'mean', 'sad', 'heartbreaking', 'way', 'think', 'complete', 'shame', 'die', 'quickly', 'sympathetic', 'focus', 'little', 'moment', 'comic', 'good', 'thing', 'happen', 'awesome', 'clothe', 'adorable', 'one', 'hazel', 'make', 'sad', 'think', 'wear', 'grow', 'year', 'lose', 'piece', 'soften', 'marko', 'mother', 'allow', 'alana', 'bond', 'small', 'way', 'meeting', 'alana', 'marko', 'odd', 'exactly', 'think', 'meet', 'jail', 'cell', 'take', 'phrase', 'hit', 'new', 'level', 'hope', 'flashback', 'series', 'maybe', 'wedding', 'great', 'scene', 'read', 'book', 'decide', 'run_away', 'marko', 'say', 'read', 'poster', 'wall', 'think', 'alana', 'love', 'book', 'similar', 'reader', 'series', 'excellent', 'way', 'bond', 'character', 'yell', 'spoiler', 'lead', 'author', 'book', 'learn', 'silly', 'book', 'book', 'real', 'opinion', 'war', 'hope', 'love', 'totally', 'read', 'book', 'couple', 'hang', 'play', 'board', 'game', 'eat', 'sandwich', 'movie', 'enter', 'gwendolyn', 'remember', 'volume', 'ex', 'fiance', 'marko', 'woman', 'steal', 'wedding', 'ring', 'exactly', 'sound', 'like', 'give', 'hug', 'find', 'help', 'find', 'prince_iv', 'make', 'appearance', 'interrogate', 'author', 'basically', 'tell', 'kill', 'clearly', 'suffer', 'deeply', 'time', 'war', 'have', 'dark', 'reaction', 'display', 'prominently', 'face', 'screen', 'know', 'lot', 'hope', 'story', 'unfold', 'completely', 'love', 'page', 'little', 'hazel', 'adorable', 'little', 'girl', 'hilarious', 'alana', 'think', 'break', 'umbilical', 'cord', 'come', 'hope', 'stay', 'adorable', 'forever', 'want', 'look', 'like', 'grow']"

89,"Tumblr Blog review: http://theliteraryinsomniac.tumblr.co... I'm a fan of Gaiman writing for several reasons: One: it's fantasy without the pretension. He crafts the most mesmerizing worlds and concepts and presents them so simply that you can't believe you've been immersed so quickly. There are no complicated apostrophied, hyphenated names to learn, no rules to watch out for. No fuss. just fantasy. Two: It's character driven without sacrificing the world building. because way too often it's one or the other. With Gaiman, you get both. Three: there's always a moral. I don't think of it as genre fiction. His books always involve a moral conflict and characters striving to do the right thing. Four: It's fun! plus it has that fairy tale quality that you can't get anywhere else. Five: It's entirely original. No new spins on an old story, he's the guy other people copy. He's got one of the most vivid imaginations in history. The sandamn is one of his landmark works. The grqphic novel series has won several awards and became a stple in the diet of any comic book fan. You can read it in one of the following ways: -In 10 separate volumes that begin with preludes and Nocturnes and progress in this order. or -In the new version with five super volumes collecting all ten. the absolute sandman. The story follows The trials of sandman, The king of the realm of dreams and nightmares and his imprisonment by an order of maegi. and his subsequent escape and revenge. This first volume only explores the very basics of the sandman world. I get the feeling this is just an introduction.

90,"Hoooooly shit, what was THAT. I thought I'd be able to write something, but I can't. It's gonna need another reread, and a long think. Suffice it to say you need to pick this up, and you absolutely have no idea what you're getting yourself into when you do. I don't know how to comment on the book any further unless I take notes while I go, which is pretty much how I use Goodreads half the time anyway. I feel a little bad about it this time around because Wrenchies is so new, so as much as it feels kind've silly I'll bracket off my notes as spoilers. Lame. (Followup: by the time I finished my notes, they became an article unto themselves. Don't bother clicking the link unless you really, really want a really, really detailed play-by-play of the entire book.) CHAPTER 1: SHERWOOD AND ORSON (p7) More of a prologue than a full chapter, this sets up the tone and associative page layouts Dalrymple will use later in the book, and also hearkens back to his work in It Will All Hurt and excerpts of Delusional. Although the panel sequences are relatively linear, there's also a tendency to guide the eye around the page rather than through it, and the voiceover will often fragment into glyphs and symbology as it tells the story. Here, the two boys from the chapter's title are running through a forest in what seems to be a modern, real-world setting. They wander into a sewer tunnel, where they're attacked by a Night Creep, a well-dressed vampiric monster whose race serves as one of the main antagonists of the book. The creature seems to live in some kind of treasure den, complete with medieval-looking weapons and magic items. The Night Creep inserts its fingers into Sherwood's eyes and seems to corrupt him somehow, while Orson finds a sword and lops off the monster's head. As he recovers, Sherwood finds an amulet that is speaking to him from the floor of the creature's cave. As he looks through it, Sherwood is transported into a floating negative space. CHAPTER 2: THE YOUNG WRENCHIES (p30) This section feels the most like what the PR on this book suggests you're getting into. Here, we jump into a strange post-apocalyptic world populated only by ruined cities, giant robots rusting into the earth, and warbands of children battling zombie hordes across the wasteland. A strange living shadow floats across these landscapes, and resurfaces throughout the book as a silent guide through the story. Our focus is on The Wrenchies, a small tribe of child-warriors who've named themselves after an old comic book (Wrenchies #1). They're one of the toughest and most well-known gangs -- they maintain a secret lair that shelters other gangs during the day, and are able to hold themselves against the zombies (called Shadowsmen) and rival gangs like the Zekes. Although this section of the book is quite long, it's mainly action and world-building. One evening, the Wrenchies survive a raid on some kind of underground rock concert in the desert by the Night Creeps, who seem to use robots to absorb older children out of existence. (Barch and Belf, a pair of bickering mice from some of Dalrymple's other works, make an appearance here.) When the Zekes are wiped out following the raid, the Wrenchies save their leader, Shakey, who takes them to the underground lair of The Scientist, a mysterious entity the Wrenchies have never heard of. At the Scientist's lair they met Olweyes, another child who explains to them that Wrenchies #1 actually contains secret codes that, when deciphered, can unlock a world of superbeings who will wipe the Shadowsmen from the earth. Olweyes offers to take the Wrenchies to the Scientist to discuss the matter further. CHAPTER 3: HOLLIS AND THE GHOST (p108) Another abrupt shift, and this section changes direction to focus on Hollis, a young overweight boy living in a modern city who is always dressed in his homemade superhero costume, and who lives in a bit of a dreamworld. Hollis has been featured in several of Dalrymple's short comics, but in Wrenchies his bizarre inability to connect to the real world is more apparent. It's not just that's he's unpopular among his peers; Hollis also seems both emotionally and mentally stunted in his understanding of the world around him. His main concern is displeasing God because of his developing sexual desires, and he spends much of his time talking to Him, and/or narrating his own day-to-day. Hollis' most recent obsession is his next door neighbor Sherwood, a single adult man who lives alone. Hollis believes that a ghost lives in Sherwood's apartment, and this ghost (a white version of the shadow being we saw in part 2) comes around to hang out with Hollis quite often. Hollis is also intrigued by his copy of Wrenchies #1, which seems to both fascinate him but make him feel strange and ashamed. After destroying a copy of the comic, Hollis steals a second one from the grocery store. Soon after, he's spying on Sherwood's apartment when a magic amulet (the same amulet we saw in part 1) appears to him. Hollis dons the amulet and falls into the comic book world of The Wrenchies. CHAPTER 4: THE SCIENTIST AND ORIGINAL WRENCHIES (p146) This section is mainly exposition, but the background for a story like this is so strange and idiosyncratic that it still clips along at a good pace. Here we meet the Scientist, a giant gray automaton that has assembled Hollis and the Wrenchies to enact a ritual that will bring the ""original Wrenchies"" (we'll call them the Originals) to their world in order to stop the Shadowsmen. The Originals are a group of adult warriors from Wrenchies #1, and when the group successively summons them through the Scientist's Bryson Vortex Tunnel, they also call through a swarm of Vortex Bugs, which the Scientist insists they must kill before they grow into nightmares. As the expanded group sets to the task, the Scientist fills them in on what's led to their being brought together. The Scientist used to be a man named Herzog Duke, who at some point in the past found himself a part of a group imprisoned on a ""space vessel"" with Sherwood and Orson, among others (more on this much later, or in It Will All Hurt). Sherwood and Duke became friends, though each would eventually escape the ship: Sherwood will return to Earth a few years after the events of Chapter 1 (implying that the amulet may have transported him to the ""space vessel"" at the end of that section), while Duke arrives centuries later, having transplanted his mind to the body of a robot and finding his home planet plagued with demons. By this point in Earth's future (the Scientist explains), the human race had been reduced to children, raised in space incubators and deposited on the planet's surface as a food source for the Shadowsmen. When the Scientist first arrived and sequestered himself in an underground sanctuary, he also constructed a radio that was able to tune into messages from Sherwood, who explained the downfall of both the planet, and himself. After his return to Earth, Sherwood had grown into a paranoid man, convinced he would bring about the destruction of the world. In an attempt to combat this fate, Sherwood spent years writing and drawing Wrenchies #1, a comic designed to summon those who would fight the oncoming evil. Sherwood also performed magic on a set of strangers who were then dropped into an alternate dimension to train for their future lives as these heroes. These strangers would become the Originals. Sherwood's predictions of doom eventually came true. The world collapsed in war and environmental disasters, and a meteor struck the planet and opened the gates to Hell, bringing forth the Shadowsmen, a race of dark elves. Sherwood's dying body, full of magic and extradimensional energy, became the source of their power. Now, the Scientist has called upon the expanded Wrenchies to walk to the dark elves' lair and destroy Sherwood. He gives the group a final tour of his underground compound, and offers them performance-enhancing drugs, then says, ""Soon we will truly be hauling ass. Prepare for our ascension to the surface!"" CHAPTER 5: THE QUEST (p188) This section is narrated again by Hollis, and documents the Wrenchies journey to find Sherwood. Along the way, four of the Originals and a few of the children are destroyed, maimed, or lost. Koole from Pop Gun War makes an appearance as a minor baddie, and the plot's associative looseness becomes a full-blown existentialist creed, as the characters spend just as much time dreaming and considering their mortality as they do fighting Shadowsmen and other assorted horrors. A child who has appeared only as a part of the background in several early scenes appears in their travels as a haunt of some kind; his name and significance will not be revealed until part 6. The white formless ghost appears again to Hollis, who in turn finds himself among a group of friends who like and accept him for the first time in his life. This may be the strongest and most evocative section of the book, although there's not much to detail in terms of plot, and much of the chapter is simply riffing on earlier images and scenes. The Wrenchies' path leads them to an abandoned cardboard box which contains a forest, which contains a shack, which leads to a basement comound full of deactivated robots in which each character must walk their own path, facing various threats both physical and psychological. After those who survive this ordeal regroup, the band descends to a cave where Sherwood's body hangs suspended in space, surrounded by a glowing green orb. CHAPTER 6: SHERWOOD PRESLEY BREADCOAT (p234) Finally we return to the end of chapter 1, as young Sherwood floats in a negative space surrounded by bubbles. Each bubble seems to pop him into different points of his life, in some sort of Dickensian review of his sins. Although the narrative actively fights against explaining itself in sequence, it seems that after several years fighting demons alongside his brother Orson, Sherwood was abducted by aliens at age 12. This led directly to Sherwood meeting Herzog Duke, and having a series of adventures which culmnated both in Duke's death in a lab experiment, and Sherwood's escape from the alien ship. Upon returning to Earth, Sherwood spent years working on and off for the government as a secret agent, but also suffered years of depression and malaise, and looked desperately for some kind of spiritual enlightenment. As an adult he met a man named Fortune Scepter who reminded him of his brother Orson (who he'd left onboard the alien vessel as a child.) He also dates a woman named Marsi (Marsi is also one of the young Wrenchies), who leaves him after his obsession with magic consumes him. After creating Wrenchies #1, Sherwood seems to lose his mind -- he casts a spell on his amulet (which will eventually lead it to Hollis) and kills Fortune. As a white ghost and a dark ghost (the shadows we've seen throughout the book) leave his body, Sherwood watches in horror while a horde of Night Creeps finally come for him. From this, we cut back to the Wrenchies standing beneath Sherwood's suspended body in the dark elves' lair. As the group fights off an army of Night Creeps, Hollis throws the amulet at Sherwood, uniting the white ghost with his corporeal body. The white ghost was Sherwood's soul, traveling through time and space to find him. The demons turn to ash and Sherwood regains consciousness. Moments later, the dark ghost arrives -- this is Sherwood's death, come to claim him. Sherwood begs forgiveness, and the Scientist crushes his skull. EPILOGUES (p280) Hollis and the Scientist return to explain that the Wrenchies continued their adventures in smaller groups, alluding to events in Dalrymple's other works, including Remainder and Supermundane. The amulet returns to the beginning of Chapter 2, where it is found by Barch and Belf. Through the amulet, we see Sherwood and Olson recovering from fighting the Night Creep in Chapter 1. Sherwood claims he had a dream where he tried to change future, but is already forgetting it. ""They know us now and are coming for us,"" he days. As they turn to leave, a Vortex Bug lands on Sherwood's eye. On the astral plane, Sherwood and Marsi laugh about the ridiculousness of the whole affair. ""You were obsessed with your own personal story...with your own pain,"" Marsi says. ""We're over it now."" And they disappear into the void. FOTOGLOCTICA (p289) The book ends with this early story that originally appeared in MeatHaus, and through it we can see many of the kernels for Wrenchies. The story is mainly a first draft of Chapter 1, and more explicitly details Sherwood and Orson's youthful incarnations (including a reminder that Orson appears as a regular in Supermundane. In this version of the story the boys dispatch the Night Creep rather easily, and as it dies a group of Night Creeps on a city rooftop sing ominously to one another. My real review follows. If you've ever taken a peek at Grant Morrison's The Invisibles (and there's no reason you need to, except if you want to know what's up when someone asks you if you've read The Invisibles, and anyone who asks you that is a blowhard, so fuck it), you may know that his intent with that project was to enact a magic rite that would echo across both his own works and others, ""a hypersigil to jump-start the culture in a more positive direction."" (wikipedia, natch) And this is a terrible and patronizing idea, and Invisibles is a terrible and patronizing book, not least of all because its painful illusions of grandeur. But that doesn't mean there's not something interesting about the concept behind it, both in being aware of a one's own cultural impact, and of the strange energies that come out of cross-textual worldbuilding. I would posit that if you've ever used terms like ""Buffyverse"" to describe Joss Whedon's body of work, or ""Diniverse"" to talk about superhero cartoons, or even been aware of the intentions behind Stephen King's Dark Tower series, there's something about hypersigilism that's being invoked. Shared story universes are the bread and butter of comics, of course -- a meta-detail that is assuredly part of the equation for The Wrenchies, as its own narrative leaps across worlds, realms, and dimensions of time and space -- and includes characters from throughout Dalrymple's past comics. As in superhero stories, there are notes of religious concern at play here as well, wrapped up in the question of God-as-Author. But rather than lose itself in Morrison's auteurish pompousity, Dalrymple's thought process works more honestly as a somewhat desperate search for self. Instead of basking in the aggrandizement of storybuilding, there is an attention here to the real human-being-people who make stories -- who do so in an attempt to find self-worth, to find community, to find inner peace. In The Wrenchies, one person might be a superhero, a secret agent, a paper pusher, and a comics artist all in a single lifetime -- but there is certain fragmentation, a trauma in all that calamity. And while there is a very real awareness of the Big Bad World outside fiction's walls, the focus of The Wrenchies lies in what happens when a person becomes too lost and broken to be able to even access that world, much less find their place in it. Such a tragic figure exists at the literal heart of The Wrenchies, and also echoes throughout its supporting cast -- the post-apocalyptic child-warriors that are the book's namesake, the rudderless kid in a nameless modern city who hopes to join them, the isolated adults cast into a land of magic without a true understanding of their own agency. The questions of existential meaning that surround these characters feed the meditative concerns at the center of the book, and their mounting paranoia about the hopelessness of their futures looms as large as the fantastic monsters that pursue them across the strange landscapes in which they find themselves. I'm not saying The Wrenchies is a perfect work (although I might be), and I'll concede that it demands no small amount of patience and a certain suspension of disbelief to be enjoyed in the first place. But I do believe it's an incredible testament to what can be done by one person in the field of comics -- and it's made my bookshelf a hell of an exciting place to be in 2014.",5,comic,"['hoooooly',

That being said, I felt that the story was well written and the action was done very well.

93,"Well I did not expect this story to break my heart. I was honestly rushing to the end, so I could say I'd finished it and moved on. At the beginning of volume book the epic conflict of the story resolved relatively quickly and quietly. I was expecting a lengthy denouement, acceptable for a long-running series such as this one. Boy was I wrong. The last chapter of this book, in my admittedly very hasty assessment, is what makes this a science-fiction story well-worth completing. Other observations, including spoilers: - MAJOR props to Bryan K. Vaughan for keeping up the 'is it science or magic' plotline throughout. The explanation even kind of justified the dream-link stuff. If this is world where there's such a thing as genetic resonance, there's definitely telepathy. - I was totally caught off-guard by three-fifty's death. And y'all, it broke me. And just abruptly ending on Yorick crying, then jumping to 60 years later and explaining everything over clips from all the saddest, inevitably tragic moments of Yorick's horrific life. I need a hug. Though let's be real. If Yorick's life was anything other than tragic the story couldn't be called honest. - Good lord, the art and layout of these books improved dramatically by the end of this series. I was really blown away by the framing of some of these panels.",5,comic,"['expect', 'story', 'break_heart', 'honestly', 'rush', 'end', 'finish', 'move', 'beginning', 'volume', 'book', 'epic', 'conflict', 'story', 'resolve', 'relatively', 'quickly', 'quietly', 'expect', 'lengthy', 'denouement', 'acceptable', 'long', 'run', 'series', 'boy', 'wrong', 'chapter', 'book', 'admittedly', 'hasty', 'assessment', 'make', 'science_fiction', 'story', 'worth', 'complete', 'observation', 'include', 'spoiler', 'major', 'prop', 'bryan', 'vaughan', 'keep', 'science', 'magic', 'plotline', 'explanation', 'kind', 'justify', 'dream', 'link', 'stuff', 'world', 'thing', 'genetic', 'resonance', 'definitely', 'telepathy', 'totally', 'catch', 'guard', 'death', 'break', 'abruptly', 'end', 'yorick', 'cry', 'jump', 'year_later', 'explain', 'clip', 'sad', 'inevitably', 'tragic', 'moment', 'yorick', 'horrific', 'life', 'need', 'hug', 'let', 'real', 'yorick', 'life', 'tragic', 'story', 'call', 'honest', 'good', 'lord', 'art', 'layout', 'book', 'improve', 'dramatically', 'end', 'series', 'blow_away', 'framing', 'panel']"
94,"I picked this book up for 2 reasons. 1) Because I needed a Graphic Novel/Manga book for Emily's Reading Challenge. 2) Because I have enjoyed the show on AMC and kept hearing about how it differed from the comic books and wanted to see for myself how it was different and if I liked it better. I'm not really a comic person, but I enjoyed this book. It is very different from the show, but not unrecognizably different (the timeline is the same for both it seems). The pacing is much better than in the show, something that takes 5 or 6 episodes in the show is told in 5 or 6 pages. The book also gives you more characters than the show and more backstory on the characters. I am not saying the show should be more like the book (in fact there are several very disturbing scenes that I do not think would ever be featured on TV  such as Carl killing Shane  )but I think fans of the show would enjoy the differences in the book. Though I enjoyed this book, I doubt that I will read the rest of the series or that I will start reading graphic novels/comics/manga regularly. Its still not a format that I find appealing. I would rather have a book full of text for my imagination to run wild on and not have someone else's pictures in my head while reading. (By the way, it seems that the show was spot on for casting just looking at the drawings in the book.) I don't judge people who enjoy graphic novels, its just not for me.

95,"I'm sorry to say I'm a touch disappointed. I'd been looking forward to finally getting the backstory on Shepherd Book--as only hints of it were ever mentioned in the original series. Book is such a sagely paternal character, and his presence rounded out the crew of Serenity with a quietly powerful temperance. Yet, it was clear he wasn't always the man he'd become. This graphic novel telling has a harsher cast to the art style than others in the series. Deep colors and hard shadows add grit but--for this reviewer at least--detracted from both the beauty and the ability to clearly discern between characters in a few scenes. The story itself is told in a series of flashbacks within flachbacks, creating a jerky narrative effect that felt disorienting to this reader on several occasions. The content itself was intriguing. The idea of Book starting out as a runaway from an abusive drunken father, surviving for a time as a volatile petty criminal, had a strongly viable resonance. That he'd volunteer himself as  a double-agent for the Independence movement back before the war with the alliance even began was a fascinating twist. In essence, he was an uncaught mole trapped behind enemy lines; forced to stay there once his cause was crushed. Lost and alone, lacking a true identity, he becomes a drifter and a drunk. Until some combination of head-trauma, the kindness of strangers, and divine revelation awakens him to a new path and purpose. Really it isn't so much the content itself as the execution that fell a bit short. Side Note: The telling also seemed to reinforce what was repeatedly indicated in the TV series--that while Shepherd Book seems blatantly intended as a theologically-educated, Bible-toting representation for Christianity, his professed version of faith is ultimately works-based rather than grace-based. It's hard to say if that denotes a lack of understanding on Joss Whedon's part, or an intentional modification. Either way, one doesn't get the sense it's a malicious misconstruing. But those who actually subscribe to the Christian faith could understandably find this aspect frustrating.",3,comic,"['sorry', 'touch', 'disappointed', 'look_forward', 'finally', 'get', 'backstory', 'shepherd', 'book', 'hint', 'mention', 'original', 'series', 'book', 'sagely', 'paternal', 'character', 'presence', 'round', 'crew', 'serenity', 'quietly', 'powerful', 'temperance', 'clear', 'man', 'graphic_novel', 'telling', 'harsh', 'cast', 'art_style', 'series', 'deep', 'color', 'hard', 'shadow', 'add', 'grit', 'reviewer', 'detract', 'beauty', 'ability', 'clearly', 'discern', 'character', 'scene', 'story', 'tell', 'series', 'flashback', 'flachback', 'create', 'jerky', 'narrative', 'effect', 'feel', 'disorienting', 'reader', 'occasion', 'content', 'intriguing', 'idea', 'book', 'start', 'runaway', 'abusive', 'drunken', 'father', 'survive', 'time', 'volatile', 'petty', 'criminal', 'strongly', 'viable', 'resonance', 'volunteer', 'double', 'agent', 'independence', 'movement', 'war', 'alliance', 'begin', 'fascinating', 'twist', 'essence', 'uncaught', 'mole', 'trap', 'enemy', 'line', 'force', 'stay', 'cause', 'crush', 'lose', 'lack', 'true', 'identity', 'drifter', 'drunk', 'combination', 'head', 'trauma', 'kindness', 'stranger', 'divine', 'revelation', 'awaken', 'new', 'path', 'purpose', 'content', 'execution', 'fall', 'bit', 'short', 'note', 'telling', 'reinforce', 'repeatedly', 'indicate', 'tv', 'series', 'shepherd', 'book', 'blatantly', 'intend', 'theologically', 'educate', 'bible', 'tote', 'representation', 'christianity', 'profess', 'version', 'faith', 'ultimately', 'work', 'base', 'grace', 'base', 'hard', 'denote', 'lack', 'understanding', 'joss', 'whedon', 'intentional', 'modification', 'way', 'sense', 'malicious', 'misconstruing', 'actually', 'subscribe', 'christian', 'faith', 'understandably', 'find', 'aspect', 'frustrating']"
96,"This review is also posted on my blog. I remain unsure about how exactly to review these manga volumes, especially now that Sailor Moon Crystal has entirely finished the Black Moon arc and it is only just starting here. It is further proven that Sailor Moon Crystal is an exact replica of the original manga (entirely unlike the 90s anime), give or take a few minor changes - and most of those I didn't even catch, since it's been many months since the beginning of the Black Moon arc has passed on the show. But there was one difference that I have to say I liked better - instead of Ami playing Berthier in the chess match, like she did in the show, she completely went on the aggressive and confronted her immediately without even beating around the bush. For the time being I have complete access to all the volumes in this series from the library, so I'm hoping I'll be able to get to all of them relatively shortly and pass the current point in the show so that I may move onto new content, and maybe be able to write a better review. I don't exactly watch the show with the intent to review - just to enjoy - so I can't say I remember what my first impressions were. All I can say, in regards to the content of this specific volume, is - FINALLY CHIBI-USA I KNOW WHERE YOU COME FROM NOW I HAVE BEEN WAITING SO LONG TO LEARN YOUR STORYLINE AND HAVE YOU INTRODUCED PROPERLY AND NOW YOU ARE INTRODUCED AND THE STORYLINE IS JUST STARTING AAAHHH~ ~ *cough* Volume four will get picked up tomorrow.

99,"Giving this a 4-star, mainly because enjoyment-wise, this volume wasn't something I enjoyed all that much compared to the previous volumes despite all the secrets dropped on us. Wow, Kureno. Can I give him a title like ""The Person Who Shall Reveal Secrets""? Seriously, this volume's biggest plot twists came from him. I remember the first time I read this and I was like ""HOLY SHIT THAT DID NOT HAPPEN!... *a few pages down* OMG THAT DID NOT HAPPEN!... *a few pages later* DAMN IT KURENO HOW MANY PLOT TWISTS ARE THERE?!"" First we learn that Kureno has a relationship with Akito that goes beyond the zodiac bond, then we learn that he's no longer bound by the curse, and yet HE REFUSES TO MEET OUR DEAR UO-CHAN, and then WE LEARN THAT AKITO IS A GIRL (!!! ), but was raised as a boy thanks to her mother (WTF?). Wow. Let me pause and let that sink in. *breathes deeply* It's no wonder Tohru reacts the way she did after learning about everything... And then we readers get to know things from Shigure's side (!!!) that Tohru doesn't know (yet?). And WTF Shigure, did you just sleep with the person your love hates the most to spite her for sleeping with another guy ??? This is so messed up, like he points out himself. And yet at the end of the volume Shigure sleeps with Akito. What. The. Actual. Flying fish. Veering away from the Sohma family drama, I love the scene between Tohru, Arisa and Saki. (Does anyone wonder why they call Tohru Tohru, but Tohru calls them by their family names...? So polite, our protagonist.) That is one of my favorite points of this series: that there's many friendships forged. Me love some sisterhood! (Although, poor Uo-chan. *pats* He'll come around, someday.) That scene of Kyo and Tohru just unleashed my inner fangirl. (KYA! KYA! KYAAAAAA!!!!) Kyo, it's SOOOOO obvious you lurve her. Fortunately (or unfortunately?) Tohru's too dense to realize it. That flower scene is just so sweet I feel like I just poured sugar into my mouth, but it's definitely worth it. *goes to fangirl* We also see a development in Yuki and Machi's relationship, and what seems like a budding romance between. A girl running after you just to say hi, when she doesn't seem all that impressed by you just a few volumes ago? Cute. I like how they're slowly discovering each other, seeing each other beyond the facades that they portray consciously or unconsciously to others. Too bad I'm not really all that invested into that relationship. Takaya needs to show more from Machi to really make us readers root for her. All in all, not a bad volume. Not one of my favorites by far, but the huge plot twists and the cute Kyo-Tohru scene make this worth it.",4,comic,"['give_star', 'mainly', 'enjoyment', 'wise', 'volume', 'enjoy', 'compare', 'previous', 'volume', 'despite', 'secret', 'drop', 'wow', 'kureno', 'title', 'like', 'person', 'shall', 'reveal', 'secret', 'seriously', 'volume', 'big', 'plot_twist', 'come', 'remember', 'time', 'read', 'like', 'holy', 'shit', 'happen', 'page', 'omg', 'happen', 'page', 'later', 'damn', 'kureno', 'plot_twist', 'learn', 'kureno', 'relationship', 'akito', 'go', 'zodiac', 'bond', 'learn', 'long', 'bind', 'curse', 'refuse', 'meet', 'dear', 'uo', 'chan', 'learn', 'akito', 'girl', 'raise', 'boy', 'thank', 'mother', 'wtf', 'wow', 'let', 'pause', 'let', 'sink', 'breathe', 'deeply', 'wonder', 'tohru', 'react', 'way', 'learn', 'reader', 'know', 'thing', 'shigure', 'tohru', 'know', 'wtf', 'shigure', 'sleep', 'person', 'love', 'hate', 'spite', 'sleep', 'guy', 'mess', 'like', 'point', 'end', 'volume', 'shigure', 'sleep', 'akito', 'actual', 'fly', 'fish', 'veer', 'away', 'sohma', 'family', 'drama', 'love', 'scene', 'tohru', 'arisa', 'saki', 'wonder', 'tohru', 'tohru', 'tohru', 'call', 'family', 'name', 'polite', 'protagonist', 'favorite', 'point', 'series', 'friendship', 'forge', 'love', 'sisterhood', 'poor', 'uo', 'chan', 'pats', 'come', 'someday', 'scene', 'kyo', 'tohru', 'unleash', 'inner', 'fangirl', 'kya', 'kya', 'kyaaaaaa', 'kyo', 'sooooo', 'obvious', 'lurve', 'fortunately', 'unfortunately', 'tohru', 'dense', 'realize', 'flower', 'scene', 'sweet', 'feel', 'like', 'pour', 'sugar', 'mouth', 'definitely_worth', 'go', 'fangirl', 'development', 'yuki', 'machi', 'relationship', 'like', 'bud', 'romance', 'girl', 'run', 'hi', 'impressed', 'volume', 'ago', 'cute', 'like', 'slowly', 'discover', 'see', 'facade', 'portray', 'consciously', 'unconsciously', 'bad', 'invested', 'relationship', 'takaya', 'need', 'machi', 'reader', 'root', 'bad', 'volume', 'favorite', 'far', 'huge', 'plot_twist', 'cute', 'kyo', 'tohru', 'scene', 'worth']"
100,"Same great writing and wit as season 8. The characters looked less like their tv counterparts in this one than season 8, except for the cover art pieces, those were much more life like. Willow got a snazzy new haircut though and she's handling the world sans magic surprisingly well. Must've been all those lessons in meditating from Giles (Season 8 Spoiler C'mon, someone in Buffy STAYING dead?? Let's not start with Giles. ). Lots of returning characters, Xander is very him but Dawn is all grown up which definitely has a different dynamic to her and Buffy's relationship (which is not even a subplot but worth saying). Spike continues his hero role and is featured in a good little short story at the back of the book, written by the humorous and talented Jane Espenson. I think Buffy was acting a bit childish at first and some whining about wanting to be normal but she got her shit together when it counted. We'll see about the next issue, especially after the bombshell at the end of this one... (no spoilers or even hints of spoilers here!) And new characters! Some I liked more than others. Buffy's new roomies were meh. We have some cop interaction here too and that pushed the plot into thrill speeds. Sev is a mixed bag, but his background really highlights some of the fallout from the magic going poof and the fallout ramifications are kinda the core to this whole issue. Finally, Eldre Koh. Badass demony dude. Can't wait to hear more about him. And he makes for a good straight man to Spike's sarcasm too.

It felt weird to me that Maddie escapes and Duncan stays and then HE escapes and she stays. I also really appreciated the author note at the end about how they were very intentional about making sure that all the violence and poor decisions had consequences for the teens.

105,"This was an ok story, very Cindy centric, a several of the Fairest stories seem to be. She's called in to investigate after a murder, since Bigby is currently unavailable. Speaking of which, this book definitely has some spoilers for the main Fables plotline, with no inkling given in the book itself where it falls within that arc. My biggest issue with the story, I think, is that the artwork changes every couple of pages, and it's wildly inconsistent. Some of it is weird cartoon-realism, and some of it is ultra-cartoony and not great quality, while some of the middle-range realism that the series, as a whole, tends to use (which is my favorite). It got to where some characters weren't even recognizable from one panel to the next. Also, the story itself is semi-moot because you know they're not going to kill off some of the main characters in a random off-shoot. I wouldn't recommend this as a starting point for people into the Fables world, unless you don't mind spoilers. Hell, I wouldn't recommend it anyway just because it's not the strongest stories and relies too heavily on familiarity with the characters as opposed to really introducing them, though it does give a smattering of backstory on some we may not have seen before. Not a bad side-story in the Fables world, but far from a necessary one. * Not only is in unclear, aside from reading, where this falls into the Fables timeline, it's not even clear where it falls on the Fairest line.

109,"I received this copy in exchange of an honest review, for so, none of my feelings were affected or biased by the author or publisher. If you'd like to read this review on my blog. Updated: 12/18/2015 Rating: 2/5 stars. In tortured life, we hear about the story of Richard, and how his life slowly turned bad by his very special gift. Now, at his lowest point, an even occurs that gives him a new reason to stay alive, and actually, fight to stay alive. When I was looking for new graphic novels to read in NetGalley (because honestly, they're so easy to read) and I saw this, I was really excited. It sounded like something that I could definitely like. But, something that I've come to realize, is an indicator of a possible bad story, is that the blur doesn't really talk about the plot. It talks about general storyline. When I read this, I wasn't sure of what was coming, but if I had known it was going to turn into this? I would have saved time and just don't read it. I was expecting some fun, adventurous, filled with paranormal story. Instead, I got an unnecessary story, with unnecessary fillings and one hell of a weird out come. I swear, if I had read the final part with the first half, I wouldn't have guessed it was the same. The story of Richard having a gift to see how people die sounded awesome, Sad for him, but awesome for me to read. But that wasn't it. There was also a weird plot about a weird ghost-avenger who wanted to kill him just because. And then the ending. The ghost was himself? And he was a clone? Of a guy who had a twin? Or was it the twin the ghost? Or was it the combination of both? All the same, the ending felt really rushed, and it felt like it hadn't been planned out at all, but rather a spur-of-the-moment kind of word-vomit. It was all over the place, and I'm not sure it made complete sense. Also, it was really grotesque. But like, really, unnecessary grotesque. It had people's brains and guts flying all over the place, and blood pouring out of the paper. And it was like the author knew his story wasn't that good and decided to stick all that blood so that people would stay. Don't get me wrong, I normally don't complain about that. The realest the better. And when I started reading this, I felt it might be that way. But then it just got ridiculous. The art style wasn't exactly pretty, and at times I wasn't sure of what the surroundings really where. Other than that, it was an enjoyable piece of work, without the guts. Even thought all this, I did enjoy some of this. It wasn't a complete and total disaster. It was fast paced, at least the first part, and kind of gripping. I don't think you should waste much time with this. And not everyone likes all this gross blood gutsy. Nah, I've wasted time. Initial Reaction Meh, I didn't like this. It had a good premise, and I only expected it to be adventurous and fun. But it had a really poor execution and nothing really happened. Also, it was confusing and had really grotesque scenes everywhere, that just became unnecessary.

110,"3.5 Stars for this graphic novel! It was a rather quick story but it wasn't bad. Initially the creepy dude with the swirly face from Chester's that hangs around the Dreamy Eyed Guy is causing trouble, slurping up parts of peoples faces and then leaving them in a vegetative state. People start going down all over with missing facial traits so Mac and Barrons(reluctantly) decide to help with the case, especially when it hits close to home with Mac. In this one we get a bit of back story with the Unseelie King and how he was tinkering around with trying to find the song of making for his beloved concubine. Once upon a time the UK and the Fear Dorcha were companions... then it all changed. At the back of the book in the spoiler section it mentions something interesting about Barrons. Supposedly because of Barrons ultimate freedom, he is the Unseelie King in the making. Which raises the question, since the UK abdicated his rule, does that mean Barrons will be the next Unseelie ruler? We also learn something about Mac that I had a feeling about but was uncertain of until the Fear Dorcha looked at her. When the Fear Dorcha looks at Mac he sees her with big black feather wing. Which means that somehow, be it by eating Unseelie flesh, having survived her brutal gang-rape and pri-ya time which includes an unfathomable overdose of fae magic by Unseelie Princes for hours. Not to mention the many months Barrons, the Unseelie King in the making, was using his unknown magics on her to regain her sanity, has turned her into the only Unseelie Princess. Did Barrons somehow change Mac into an Unseelie Princess? He can destroy them, so if he really wanted to, could he create one? I would say it's highly likely. In the Character notes, it states that Jericho has wanted Mac since the beginning and that he has been ruthlessly altering her to make her suitable for him. Perhaps that is foreshadowing that he means for her to change not just on a mental/emotionl level, but on a physiological level as well. I think he wants a she beast who likes to shack up in the swamp! Earlier in the books Cruce wasn't taunting Mac when he called her Princess, he knew that she had changed into one. Just like Cruce being the only UP to have wings because he was the first, so does Mac for she is truly the first Unseelie Princess. Hot Damn! As the art in the book goes, it looks really good! I like the different or perhaps true take on what everything looks like, but in my head quite a few things look waaaayyyy different. This comic won't change my mind but it was refreshing to see what someone else envisioned. The only complaint I have with the art is that all the female faces look pretty much exactly the same. The guys look a bit constipated too but other than that it's good! Overall I found it to be enjoyable! Has some nice back story. Plus Barrons. Need I say more?

111,"Series review: This was very fast-paced and an engaging read; I could not put it down! I loved how strong and courageous Yuri was, and I loved how dedicated Kail was to her. This had a good cast of characters, and the author wasn't afraid to kill one of them off, if it fit the plot. Also, the last volume is mostly an extended epilogue. Yay for epilogues! Some complaints: -How come pretty much everything bad that happened to the couple could be traced to Nakia? There were plenty of things in their lives and relationship that would cause trouble for them; it didn't need to always be a plot by Nakia. But defeating her did give the story a great climax at the end in a way it couldn't have if she wasn't the whole story's villain. I just got sick of ""Oh, no! It's Nakia's black water!"" all the time. -How in the world was a 16 or 17 year old girl (who had lived an average, peace-filled life for 15 of those years, and had never had any military/strategy training) fit to be the commander of an army? I could see her being the motivational leader of the army (""Yes! We can do this because Ishtar supports us!"") but not the actual leader of an army that has to fight (& win) major battles with the armies of other countries. This seemed completely ridiculous to me. -I wish there had been more about the culture and land this takes place in.

112,"I'm going to be honest: I didn't go into this book expecting too much. I truly expected that it would be almost completely devoid of substance, whether that substance be negated by overuse of humor or overemphasis on an exciting plot. I could not have been more wrong. Certainly there was humor, and there was an exciting plot, but both of these served the greater purpose of exemplifying the resilience and overall altruism of humanity. The following quote isn't necessarily a ""spoiler"" per se (it is essentially a sumation of the theme found on the final page), but I'll hide it just in case. ...every human being has a basic instinct to help each other out. It might not seem that way sometimes, but it's true. I'll admit, it did give me pause to find that the broad theme was explicitly stated on the final page (definitely seems like a red flag), but, to my surprise, it actually works! It works for the same reason it works throughout the entire book: The sections written as logs by Mark Watney follow something of a stream of consciousness structure, and thus directly shows his own realistic realizations! I would explain that specific issue further, but it would definitely spoil the ending as if we didn't already know how it was going to end . So, instead let's examine Watney's humor. For about the first third of the book, I loved it. It was dry--it was ridiculous--it was pleasing to me. After that it began getting a little old. I've realized that there's more to it than simply how much I laughed, however. It's more about how much Watney laughed. It is just another illustration of the human spirit. This assertion may seem difficult to believe, even ridiculous, if not for the fact that Watney exhibited other emotions as well. In fact, he proved to be a rather multi-dimensional character with the humor as simply a mechanism to suppress these feelings and make the best of a terrible situation. Furthermore, all [most, rather] of the logs written by Watney would have been written a short amount of time after the fact--after he'd had time to collect himself. The setting also gives opportunity to so many possibilities--extreme isolation/loneliness, hopelessness, self-reflection, etc. Weir effectively touched upon all of these without making melodramatic garbage! Furthermore, there is the broad range of emotions of those on Earth and the other members of the crew. And in addition, it is an interesting plot! It is somehow eventful despite the amount of downtime and ""technical description."" The problems and solutions are intriguing, ""out there,"" and yet somehow realistic and believable. I cannot believe I'm saying this, but holy buckets there was so much suspense (despite the fact that everyone knows how the book ends). It was just wonderful. Naturally, there were some instances where it didn't work. A lot of the plot twists/solutions were rather sudden and coincidental. A lot of the humor in the latter half of the group was rather ""eh."" A lot of the information (not to mention the themes) seemed rather spoon-fed to the reader (if I had a nickle for every time I read a phrase resembling ""Hey, remember this detail that I touched upon a couple of pages back? Did you catch that because that's about to become important now!""). Having finished the book, though, I found all of this somehow very forgivable. All things considered, I'm hovering around a four and a half stars. I really want to say five stars, but I just can't quite bring myself to do it. Nonetheless, I absolutely recommend this to just about anybody. It was enjoyable, and it essentially lifted me from a month-long reading slump. What more can I really say? I just really liked it for some reason.",4,fantasy,"['go', 'honest', 'book', 'expect', 'truly', 'expect', 'completely', 'devoid', 'substance', 'substance', 'negate', 'overuse', 'humor', 'overemphasis', 'exciting', 'plot', 'wrong', 'certainly', 'humor', 'exciting', 'plot', 'serve', 'great', 'purpose', 'exemplify', 'resilience', 'overall', 'altruism', 'humanity', 'follow', 'quote', 'necessarily', 'spoiler', 'se', 'essentially', 'sumation', 'theme', 'find', 'final', 'page', 'hide', 'case', 'human', 'basic', 'instinct', 'help', 'way', 'true', 'admit', 'pause', 'find', 'broad', 'theme', 'explicitly', 'state', 'final', 'page', 'definitely', 'like', 'red', 'flag', 'surprise', 'actually', 'work', 'work', 'reason', 'work', 'entire', 'book', 'section', 'write', 'log', 'mark', 'watney', 'follow', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'structure', 'directly', 'show', 'realistic', 'realization', 'explain', 'specific', 'issue', 'definitely', 'spoil', 'ending', 'know', 'go', 'end', 'instead', 'let', 'examine', 'watney', 'humor', 'book', 'love', 'dry', 'ridiculous', 'pleasing', 'begin', 'get', 'little', 'old', 'realize', 'simply', 'laugh', 'watney', 'laugh', 'illustration', 'human', 'spirit', 'assertion', 'difficult', 'believe', 'ridiculous', 'fact', 'watney', 'exhibit', 'emotion', 'fact', 'prove', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'character', 'humor', 'simply', 'mechanism', 'suppress', 'feeling', 'good', 'terrible', 'situation', 'furthermore', 'log', 'write', 'watney', 'write', 'short', 'time', 'fact', 'time', 'collect', 'setting', 'give', 'opportunity', 'possibility', 'extreme', 'isolation', 'loneliness', 'hopelessness', 'self', 'reflection', 'etc', 'weir', 'effectively', 'touch', 'make', 'melodramatic', 'garbage', 'furthermore', 'broad', 'range', 'emotion', 'earth', 'member', 'crew', 'addition', 'interesting', 'plot', 'eventful', 'despite', 'downtime', 'technical', 'description', 'problem', 'solution', 'intriguing', 'realistic', 'believable', 'believe', 'say', 'holy', 'bucket', 'suspense', 'despite_fact', 'know', 'book', 'end', 'wonderful', 'naturally', 'instance', 'work', 'lot', 'plot_twist', 'solution', 'sudden', 'coincidental', 'lot', 'humor', 'half', 'group', 'eh', 'lot', 'information', 'mention', 'theme', 'spoon', 'feed', 'reader', 'nickle', 'time', 'read', 'phrase', 'resemble', 'hey', 'remember', 'detail', 'touch', 'couple', 'page', 'catch', 'important', 'having', 'finish', 'book', 'find', 'forgivable', 'thing', 'consider', 'hover', 'half', 'star', 'want', 'star', 'bring', 'nonetheless', 'absolutely', 'recommend', 'anybody', 'enjoyable', 'essentially', 'lift', 'month', 'long', 'reading', 'slump', 'like', 'reason']"

Never the less, she has an uncanny ability when it comes to fighting vamps. Her relationships with Michael and Victor are changing. I'd hoped for more interaction with Victor, considering his new position. But, I liked how Dawn & Victor now share a unique connection. I really like the post-vamp/human-war world that Rachel and her son (together they use the pseudo J.A.

116,"No,no,just no. i don't know why i always come back to young adult fiction even though i almost always get disappointed. maybe because of the obvious reason that i'm young or that i did not read many fiction books during my teen years. whatever it is, the fault is mine. the thing about Maggie stiefvater is that she is good at romance. she's good at making up romantic yet cool dialogues, what she is not good at is the other stuff you expect in a paranormal or fantasy book. i mean after four books she could have tried to juice it up a little( i don't like this phrase but can't think of anything else at the moment, flashback to Joey Tribbiani: ""juice this puppy up a little!"") things were not slow in this book although it wouldn't have bothered me if they were, but they were not intriguing either. i kept on reading these books because let's be fair they have some good parts and i like the characters and their development, but if you're reading a book only because of its characters or even one favorite character and you can't seem to care about where the story is going, the writer is not doing a good job. speaking of our raven boys: i should give credit to Stiefvater. the boys are fun and interesting and even a little bit mysterious( still only Ronan comes to mind) , but as i mentioned, their mysteries are not enough for a whole book and not even near enough for a final installment. all this search for Glendower and that pathetic excuse of a dead body at the end? now the romance parts: i hate it when an author makes us wait such a long time for something as little as a kiss and finally goes like: and they kissed!! that's it? really? there was such a hype around the quote :"" i wrote two kisses in this book"", well i have to say you did not do a very good job of manifesting them. even if we look past the Ronan/Adam parts that were somehow better, the parts about Gansey and blue were disasters, i barely got a small ""Aw"" out of me during the whole book. all things considered, this book was just okay and that is only because i refuse to think of it as anything other than romance. not satisfying at all.",2,fantasy,"['know', 'come', 'young_adult', 'fiction', 'disappoint', 'maybe', 'obvious', 'reason', 'young', 'read', 'fiction', 'book', 'teen', 'year', 'fault', 'thing', 'maggie', 'stiefvater', 'good', 'romance', 'good', 'make', 'romantic', 'cool', 'dialogue', 'good', 'stuff', 'expect', 'paranormal', 'fantasy', 'book', 'mean', 'book', 'try', 'juice', 'little', 'like', 'phrase', 'think', 'moment', 'flashback', 'joey', 'tribbiani', 'juice', 'puppy', 'little', 'thing', 'slow', 'book', 'bother', 'intriguing', 'keep', 'read', 'book', 'let', 'fair', 'good', 'part', 'like', 'character_development', 'read', 'book', 'character', 'favorite', 'character', 'care', 'story', 'go', 'writer', 'good_job', 'speak', 'raven', 'boy', 'credit', 'stiefvater', 'boy', 'fun', 'interesting', 'little', 'bit', 'mysterious', 'ronan', 'come', 'mind', 'mention', 'mystery', 'book', 'near', 'final', 'installment', 'search', 'glendower', 'pathetic', 'excuse', 'dead', 'body', 'end', 'romance', 'part', 'hate', 'author', 'make', 'wait', 'long', 'time', 'little', 'kiss', 'finally', 'go', 'like', 'kiss', 'hype', 'quote', 'write', 'kiss', 'book', 'good_job', 'manifest', 'look', 'past', 'ronan', 'adam', 'part', 'well', 'part', 'gansey', 'blue', 'disaster', 'barely', 'get', 'small', 'aw', 'book', 'thing', 'consider', 'book', 'okay', 'refuse', 'think', 'romance', 'satisfying']"

118,"Actual Rating: 2.5 stars I picked up this book because I thought it would be related to greek mythology, which I love, especially Poseidon. Although, it had nothing to do with that, I still enjoyed this book. It had mermaids or Syrenas or whatever you want to call them. After my obsession and years of wanting to be a mermaid, I would say that I love them almost as much as Greek mythology. The plot was interesting. Anna Banks managed to create another world and perspective for her readers. That being said, this book was very...strange. I wasn't really feeling the characters in this book. In my opinion, the characters, besides the plot, are the most important part of the story. They should be likable and easy to relate to. The only two characters I actually liked were Toraf, who was a minor character, and Chloe, who died in the first few chapters. Emma was too emotional and rash. She didn't really handle the given situations well, with the exception of Chloe and the shark. She often let the her anger get the best of her. I mean, I have a horrible temper too, but you don't see me throwing people out hurricane-proof glass walls. I'd say that's a little too far. She got upset over some little, irrelevant things. However, I did like her feisty attitude. She had some standards and managed to make me laugh. I disliked Rayna for pretty much the same reasons as Emma. She was too impulsive and rude. She treated Toraf like trash in the beginning. That would have been somewhat understandable if she didn't like him, but she did...so she was hurting him on purpose. Galin was alright. His hatred to the human race in the beginning was kind of a turn off, but he kind of grew on me as the book went on. I kind of expected the twist at the ending. With all the hints in the book, it became kind of obvious.

Everything connected so perfectly in the end and I feel so bad for Wax. Poor, poor fella. A good sequel but Alloy of Law was better. This book contained more references to original trilogy than the previous one. There were also some old characters that returned. Nostalgia was strong in this one. Even so,  I'm so disappointed in Sazed for what he did to Wax. If it were Vin or Kelsier instead, I would've expected it. But I could never expect such kind of ruthlessness from Sazed. He knows better than anyone how it feels to lose your beloved, and yet he put Wax in the dark regarding Lessie. And Lessie, oh I can't put it into words how shocked I was to find out that she was actually a Kandra and the villain. Wax was justified to lose it there. I'd be surprised if Wax ever recovers from this kind of betrayal. Steris really grew on me in this book and I think she will make a good wife for Wax. Of course if it were up to me I would still go for Marasi and Wax, but lets be realistic, it could never work out between them. Marasi lives a dangerous life and if anything happened to her during her duty, Wax would again think it was his fault. Plus there is that age difference. No, Steris is nice and they would make a good couple. Branden is following the same strategy with villains as he did in original trilogy. What with each villain being stronger than the one in previous book. Lets see how Wax unfolds the mysteries around him. I have a feeling his family has more secrets than his uncle lets on.

121,"I did a re-read of the first one, and was SO ready to hide in this book for a few hours, and hallelujah Keira Andrews did it again. The first one was a big surprise for me, the premise was weird, BUT awesome. This one starts up on the boat and Parker is really growing up and becoming an AWESOME character. (He wasn't that bad in the first one, but he acted more entitled and he was kinda all over the place, until they came to the resort) Here Parker is strong, capable, a 'reasonable' voice and cautious (in the GOOD way in a freaking zombie apocalypse). And Adam, OOOHHHH Adam is just wonderful! (And thankfully a werewolf!) I think they make an awesome couple in this book, and they work together without too much drama. (Yes, there are discussions/fights, but I think that makes it more real) None of them have more power, they are equal, and I think that works really well, they complement each other. They meet Craig, Abby, Lily and Jacob when they rescue them (I love Parker's irritation with people trying to survive the apocalypse by being on a boat, when they can't handle it. That is freaking funny) And they become a sort of family, even though it is really hard for Parker to trust anybody after the resort (in book one) and the attack on the boat when Adam was on a supply-run! I loved what Craig and Abby added and I hope that Jacob will get a book of his own, I think he could be an awesome MC This is very much a zombie/apocalypse/horrible world. And for fans of 'The Walking Dead' I think this will be a hit, but beware: there is fisting, which was tasteful (as much as that can be), sex where Adam is half-shifted and an assault on the boat where I really feared for Parker  There is also love, a developing mature/adult relationship and being a team for each other and other people. They make it to Salvation Island, and the Island is written like it can be AWESOME, but also like you don't know what's going to happen. I got a vibe from Connie and Bethany, and it will be really nice to see where the 'world' is going to end up.

122,"I said the previous book in this series was the first one that I didn't immediately think was better than the one before it. Well, by that standard this book got things back on track. This volume has all the things I love about the series: Interesting use of previous characters, Morgan and Dresden being forced to work together to prove Morgan's innocence, and good use of the Alphas  development of the Black Council story line, although the reveal of the secretary as the bad guy was a little anticlimactic, and this arc really needs to start moving faster  and new supernatural threats the skinwalker . I really don't know how well the author has plotted out the whole series, but it feels very cohesive to me. This has got to be the longest series I've read where I can still say that. Certainly keeps me coming back for more.",4,fantasy,"['say', 'previous', 'book', 'series', 'immediately', 'think', 'well', 'standard', 'book', 'get', 'thing', 'track', 'volume', 'thing', 'love', 'series', 'interesting', 'use', 'previous', 'character', 'morgan', 'dresden', 'force', 'work', 'prove', 'morgan', 'innocence', 'good', 'use', 'alphas', 'development', 'black', 'council', 'story', 'line', 'reveal', 'secretary', 'bad_guy', 'little', 'anticlimactic', 'arc', 'need', 'start', 'move', 'fast', 'new', 'supernatural', 'threat', 'skinwalker', 'know', 'author', 'plot', 'series', 'feel', 'cohesive', 'get', 'long', 'series', 'read', 'certainly', 'keep', 'come']"
123,"Another book from that Humble Bundle that had a bunch of Simon and Schuster YA books. This book was OK. Not my cup of tea, but not bad. As I said in my status updates, Ms Black is pretty good at subverting my expectations. I'll get back to this in a moment. For someone who could not really care less about ""the fey"" as fairies are apparently called, especially if they're spelled ""faerie"", I've ended up with a lot of fey books via various bundles. So there are lots of tropes I'm not familiar with, like the fact that faeries are apparently deathly allergic to iron. Why is that? Does it have to do with why we don't see faeries now? Because of the iron age of humans? Luckily, this book was written for people were a little less familiar because it explained things like changelings, kupies, and the iron allergy. Between reddit, Goodreads, and other forums, I've seen a lot of debates about adults reading YA. Frankly, I think a good story is a good story. My current position (subject to change with experience and age) is that the only annoying thing about YA can be the fact that the older you, the less tolerance you have for teenage BS. My traditional example is rooting for Ariel in Disney's Little Mermaid as she rebels against the authoritarian regime of her father's rule vs watching as an adult and realizing she's a spoiled little brat who's lucky as eff she doesn't end up dead or sexually used and abused. What's often neat about YA, by contrast, is that it's often pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Adult fiction is so staid...so risk-averse like the movie industry. Meanwhile in YA we have lots of women protagonists, people of color, LGBT people, etc. Unlike Middlegrade books, the characters can also be a little more realistic and a little less black and white in terms of morality. This often leads me to have some caveats on my reviews when it comes to the fact that some parents are more liberal and some are more conservative. Some authors are like - YA == teens and teens have sex so everyone needs to be boning. When it comes to this book - I have to say that I disagree slightly with Jilly's (a GR friend) review. While this book's main character (Kaye) is not a good role model for teens, I have some hopes for her as a character. What are her flaws: she actively skips school, she smokes, she relishes the attention her best friend's boyfriend gives her and does not stop him from kissing her. All very mild by YA standards. But I think there isn't much glamorized about her faults and even Kaye is often disappointed at where she is in life. No goodie-two-shoes kid is going to read about Kaye and decide to be like her. What I do hope is that if some kid who's on the same track as Kaye reads this book they can see themselves in the character and perhaps become life-long readers (which will serve them well in life) and/or change course. Of course, there's also option 3 - a kid who's never going to act like Kaye, but can live vicariously through her. Just like I don't have any misconceptions about the evils of killing, but it can be fun to act in cartooney violence in Team Fortress 2. So, let's get to the story itself. The story initially sets itself up the same way as Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland. Kaye used to play with faeries as a kid, but hasn't seen them since her family moved out of Jersey. Her mom is in a band, rather than perhaps asking the grandma to watch over Kaye (or some other stabilizing situation) turns her into a roadie. So Kaye becomes a bad girl...although, as I said above, VERY TAME compared to the kids I knew in school. Sure, I ran with the goodie-two-shoes kids, but I had friends all over school and if even half of what they claimed to do was true at the time, Kaye's pretty mild. Shoot, she doesn't even do drugs, she just smokes. Things go awry and Kaye and her mom move back to Jersey to temporarily live with grams. Kaye hooks back up with her literal trailer park friend and they get up to teenage mischief, including going to an abandoned building where Kaye almost gets raped by her friend's boyfriend. The faeries make an appearance and we learn that Kaye wasn't just making things up as a kid. I'm going to stop here in case you actually want to read the book. Because Ms Black has quite a few twists and turns that were entertaining for someone like me that is such a trope nerd, he barely ever gets surprised watching TV or movies. I think a good book subverts my expectations at least once. This book does it multiple times, including one almost Fight Club-level twist. (I'll admit some of this could be due to me not being a fey nerd) What things did I really like that aren't spoilery: -There's a gay character who isn't a stereotype. In fact, until he reveals that he's gay there's nothing to betray that fact. I'm of the opinion that when it comes to non-standard characters (non-white, middle class male) what's best is to have a character that is in most ways no different than a standard character except for a few things that are informed by the difference. For example, an African American character doesn't have to have ghetto-speak or even come from the wrong side of the tracks. But perhaps, especially in today's environment, he could have a slightly heightened suspicion of authority. The gay character in this book is like that. There are some things that are informed by the fact that he's gay, but he's not a walking stereotype. -Kaye feels very conflicted about her near rape. I'm not female bodied, so I'll never had the same understanding of rape as a woman, but from what I've heard, some girls/women end up feeling extremely conflicted about the emotions and bodily reactions. Some feel weird or shamed or guilty if some part of them enjoyed it or even feel betrayed if their body was willing (I'm going to leave it there to not get too explicit here) and Kaye is no exception. Especially because the rape doesn't happen and her teenage hormones, it makes sense. -Related to that, I like that Kaye feels unsure of how she's reacting with her best friend's bf. I think this can persist into adulthood (to a stronger or weaker degree depending on the person), but as a teen, it can be hard in the moment to override hormones, desire, etc if someone's in your personal space. Since the guy is actively going after her rather than the opposite, it makes it even more complicated. She's not doing anything to make this guy pursue her so there's less guilt compared to if she was actively trying to steal her friend's man. Also, given her nomadic lifestyle and self-described weirdness, maybe she's extra jonesing for some intimacy because she hasn't had much/any? -Again, without getting into spoilers, I really like that there's a lot more shades of grey with the motivations of many characters, especially the fey. I get this is a bit of trope with fey fiction, but other than the one Discworld novel that dealt with faeries, I'm not used to them being anything but Tinkerbells. Wow, this review really ballooned beyond where I thought it would go when I started writing. So, who do I recommend this to? If you're an adult who's not REALLY into YA, it might be a bit too kiddie for you. But if you really like YA and like faerie/fey stuff, jump right in. If you're a teen - it's going to depend on whether you're into faerie stuff and/or Kaye's life seems authentic or not to your experience. If you're a parent - I personally think this is one of the mildest YA books I've read in terms of objectionable stuff. (Shoot, the kids I grew up with who went to church 3 times a week did more sexually than Kaye does) I'd only avoid if you're one of those super religious people who don't let their kids read Harry Potter. If your kids are less than teenage, but advanced at reading - you might want to have an open dialogue or offer an open dialogue with your kid so they can talk about anything that makes them uncomfortable. Although Kaye and someone she ends up in bed with don't do anything other than kiss - there is the fact that she's sharing the bed with someone she's attracted to. Also, there is the death of one of her peers",3,fantasy,"['book', 'humble', 'bundle', 'bunch', 'simon', 'schuster', 'ya', 'book', 'book', 'ok', 'cup', 'tea', 'bad', 'say', 'status', 'update',

Although really if there had been more than one guy who  didn't hit women in the face  perhaps the battle for Kricket's heart would have been more even.

125,"I'm really struggling with what to make of this book. Based on the synopsis and genre it should be something I really got into but there is just something off with it. The writing isn't terrible, although reading some of it did really stretch even my cheese tolerance  like this ""Brent was holding me in his arms. When I closed my eyes, it felt like he was physically next to me and I was in his warm embrace."" Or this gem ""Its leaves blazed with color that could have inspired a sonnet; I wished I were a poet and could capture its beauty in words."" but I couldn't shake the feeling that the book felt like a story written by a 16 year old for creative writing homework. While the book was very, very descriptive and clearly attempted to create a strong atmosphere I felt lost quite often with what was going on, the story jumping suddenly from describing how wonderful the landscape was to  a hurried battle. I could never quite connect with the characters properly. Especially Yara; it didn't feel like enough of her background was explained or what being a Waker actually meant. I found it difficult to care that she was embarrassed by this ""crazy"" part of her family or  how hot she constantly finds Brent - really it was no surprise whatsoever when they admit their feelings for each other. The love story actually felt really frustrating and disjointed. With Brent  obviously his character changed after Thomas took over but he never felt fully explored either. Thomas' real back story and the story of Pendrel also feel unfinished It may be that almost all my negative points are due to in part because this is the first part of a trilogy so things won't be explained fully in just 290 pages. But I'm not sure I found this book interesting enough to actually carry on the series, which is not something I say often because I tend to hate leaving trilogies and book series unfinished. I'm still unsure, I want to like it...but there is just something holding me back from giving it a full 3 stars, unfortunately Goodreads don't allow half points so on record it's roughly a 2.5 but I'm giving it 3 stars on here, maybe it deserves the benefit of the doubt.",3,fantasy,"['struggle', 'book', 'base', 'synopsis', 'genre', 'get', 'writing', 'terrible', 'read', 'stretch', 'cheese', 'tolerance', 'like', 'brent', 'hold', 'arm', 'close', 'eye', 'feel', 'like', 'physically', 'warm', 'embrace', 'gem', 'leave', 'blaze', 'color', 'inspire', 'sonnet', 'wish', 'poet', 'capture', 'beauty', 'word', 'shake', 'feeling', 'book', 'feel', 'like', 'story', 'write', 'year_old', 'creative', 'writing', 'homework', 'book', 'descriptive', 'clearly', 'attempt', 'create', 'strong', 'atmosphere', 'feel', 'lost', 'go', 'story', 'jump', 'suddenly', 'describe', 'wonderful', 'landscape', 'hurried', 'battle', 'connect', 'character', 'properly', 'especially', 'yara', 'feel', 'like', 'background', 'explain', 'waker', 'actually', 'mean', 'find', 'difficult', 'care', 'embarrass', 'crazy', 'family', 'hot', 'constantly', 'find', 'brent', 'surprise', 'whatsoever', 'admit', 'feeling', 'love', 'story', 'actually', 'feel', 'frustrating', 'disjointed', 'brent', 'obviously', 'character', 'change', 'thomas', 'take', 'feel', 'fully', 'explore', 'thomas', 'real', 'story', 'story', 'pendrel', 'feel', 'unfinished', 'negative', 'point', 'trilogy', 'thing', 'will', 'explain', 'fully', 'page', 'sure', 'find', 'book', 'interesting', 'actually', 'carry', 'series', 'tend', 'hate', 'leave', 'trilogy', 'book', 'series', 'unfinished', 'unsure', 'want', 'like', 'hold', 'give_star', 'unfortunately', 'goodreads', 'allow', 'half', 'point', 'record', 'roughly', 'give_star', 'maybe', 'deserve', 'benefit', 'doubt']"
126,"Ok, I liked this book, but I give it 3 stars for the sake that there was way too much convenience in the story. I spent the whole book hoping that Sage was not really the crown prince in disguise, and was disappointed in this. It all felt too contrived at the end with everything coming together in a nice and neat ending perfectly tied with a bow. I felt tricked that the author hadn't allowed the reader into the confidence that Sage and Jaron were the same person and felt the need to make it such a ham-fisted reveal towards the end of the book. The way that she would leave out large chunks of the story and then later conveniently make them work out in such nice and convenient ways was just too hard to look past to me. The big reveal at the end of the book was too contrived, too convenient, and rather cliche. That being said, I did enjoy it for purely escapist reasons. This is a great middle school aged read. I think kids will enjoy it immensely as it has some good intrigue and is a good way to introduce characters to such thing as an unreliable narrator (that sometimes switches to an omniscient 3rd person which is kinda sloppy on the part of the author, but it is minimal and thus forgivable), as well as some fairly decent moral issues. The bad guys are a little 2 dimensional, but there are some times when you're not sure who the real bad guy is, which is something that can drive you along. Sage is a fairly good character, but he's too smug and has waaaay too much figured out for a 15 year old... but again, that's forgivable for the sake of the story's progression. That's the main thing that bothered me, Sage is never surprised for any real length of time, he's able to outwit everyone with absolute ease, as if he has a sense of prescience that allows him to know exactly what will happen and again is never surprised when things go exactly how he foresaw and is able to roll with the punches way better than a person who's gone through as much emotional turmoil and suffered abandonment issues and other horrible things that our hero has undergone. For all the tragedy and awful abandonment that he's gone through, Sage is amazingly well adjusted and entirely too trusting of people around him. Again, though this review doesn't really show it, I did enjoy the book. I felt that it had some merit and it taught some good morals and was definitely worth my time to read it, and I plan to read the subsequent sequels as well. Its' apparent flaws are mostly absolved when you realize that this was a book meant for very young adults and, when read on that level, is a very enjoyable read.

127,"This was fun and cute, with a town of dog shifters led by their Border-collie sheriff, Lance, trying to figure out what's up with new all-human arrival Tim. Tim gets into town smelling of marijuana, with no money, only a few seeds and tools, and a lie about his name. In the isolated small town, the possibility he's going to grow pot is strong, and Lance feels compelled to investigate. A lot. Often. Sometimes in Border-collie form. Maybe the compulsion comes from something other than his suspicions about young, geeky and perplexing Tim. I enjoyed their interactions, and I could see some readers loving the fun of this one. I had a few chuckles from it, and it was a smooth, easy light read. I'm a bit picky about shifter stories. I want to believe the paranormal ones, or have a magic wild enough to wash away the need for belief. This humorous story was set firmly in the contemporary, and required suspension of belief in many ways, not least the fact that ""quickened"" dogs somehow became adult humans with a full vocabulary and understanding of the human world, and without arousing suspicions...  ... whatever. Suspend. I'm awful at that, and it was a distraction.

129,"Pure and simple, this was mind-drillingly boring. I felt like a high-schooler again, forcing myself through just to say I finished. Although I've always been a book lover, I was a pretty poor student of literature in high school because the significant but torturously dull classics I was forced to read weren't even of my own choosing. I was having flashbacks to senior year with D.H. Lawrence. ""I've got to read 20 more pages tonight because teacher said so, but I don't wanna!"" Constant checking to see ""How much longer?"" Crossing my fingers that ""The next book I read has to be better than THIS."" So bored that I couldn't even carry the plot sometimes, and had to go back and figure out what had just happened. Basically, my attitude towards this book (before, during, and after reading it) is that of a petulant teenager. Given how much I liked Out of the Silent Planet, I'm genuinely stunned that I one-starred book three of the same trilogy almost on boringness alone. When a book is so dull as to fail to retain even a shred of interest from [this] reader, how can it even hope to engender any remarks about thematic material or allegorical messages? I mean, I recognize that they were there but given that they failed to scrape a second star for That Hideous Strength it almost feels like a waste of my time to go into it because obviously they weren't compelling or well-framed enough to take this poor book from one star to two. But as I said, this book makes me feel moody and combative. It was probably doomed as soon as this trilogy took the linguistic fascination I had in ""Out of the Silent Planet"", reduced it to intriguing but flawed biblical allegory in ""Perelandra"", and turned the lens inward to Earth for ""That Hideous Strength"". As soon as I knew the focus of this book was staying on Earth, I knew we were gonna get into heavy morals and WWII commentary. Once the story didn't offer me any more than a bear with a hilarious name, the Space Trilogy lost be completely. As for the ""Fairy Tale"" byline, that's pretty genuinely confusing to me, unless we're looking to imply that there's a moral to the story and it's nine-tenths about gruesomely punishing the wicked.

130,"4 Stars. Frostblood was a fun read, with lots of adventure, drama, a little dash of romance and a dark undertone with really made this book fascinating. Certainly, I was reminded often of other elemental and blood-linked magic books (I'm looking at you, Red Queen), but this didn't hamper my enjoyment of the book at all, and in fact, made me like it more. The focus on two elemental powers was interesting - Frostbloods and Firebloods - and I have a feeling this world will be expanded on in future books. The real strength in Frostblood is the constant action and big build up to the arena stuff in Part 2 (yeah, which reminded me of Red Queen again). Something was always happening, and I found it really intriguing to read as the characters were thrown again and again into more dire situations. The arena scenes in particular where both harrowing and empowering, especially as the level of cruelty is explored properly and thoughtfully and not condoned or simply utilized as a plot point, referring to the violent entertainment of Ancient Rome. How the author revealed the mythology was really fascinating and unusual  absolutely adored how this was achieved for the reader - yes, Ruby already knew, but revealing it through the scene with Ruby running away and overhearing a camp of people telling the children the stories was great. Further, that this then resulted in Ruby returning to fulfil her responsibilities was extra wonderful   and whilst I won't deny it was a bit of an information dump, I didn't overly mind it at all. That being said, it was a little hard to keep track of all the names and such, even with only two elements in play. I also really appreciate that this story arc is completed fully, and that a new arc will begin in the next book, rather than a full, blown-out cliff-hanger. I love cliff-hangers, but it makes for a nice change. The characters were all interesting, especially the MC, Ruby. She was wild and passionate, like her fire powers, but whilst I won't deny I found her a little abrasive at the start, she grew on me and I really felt her emotional struggles at the end. Arcus was suitably mysterious and grumpy, and the other characters managed to become favourites even with short page time. Brother Thistle and Marella certainly became favourites. The romance was a hate-to-love relationship, and I can't help it, I always love those relationships. At the start, the hate between Arcus and Ruby felt a little overdone, but then suddenly it clicked and I was so happy for them to get together. Sure, there was a little wobble and hint of a love triangle, but I wouldn't even consider it a love triangle at all. I can't wait to read more about their love unfolding. Frostblood was fascinating, had a strong MC, romance, magic and lots of fight scenes, and would certainly be a favourite for reader's who love Red Queen, Burning Glass, Air Awakens, Snow Like Ashes or any other elemental magic stories. I can't wait to for the next instalment! *Thank-you to Hachette Australia and Net Galley for this ARC.

131,"Reads like the novelization of a Michael Bay movie. Like Transformers, but admittedly much better. The standard elements of a made-for-teen-boys Michael Bay film are there, however. The absurdly hot girl love interest who is also absurdly bitchy. The awkward teen boy, who despite being awkward is also a bit of a Larry Stu, loved by the good guys and possessing mad skillz. Secondary characters who are quickly sketched archetypes: the plucky comic relief; the sage warrior; the tech wizard; the team leader with a mysterious past. The story gives itself a convenient ""out,"" with regard to characterization, stating that team members shouldn't know much about each other because of the risk of capture and death. There are big explosions and car chases and all things action-y, and yet, in order to keep the story PG-rated, expletives are limited to made-up (and lame, lame, lame) words like ""sparks"" or ""Calamity."" Of course, unlike Bay, Sanderson doesn't seem to be intentionally and overtly serving his audience a shit sandwich, and laughing as they dig into the brown, gooey feast. Steelheart has heart, just not enough to overcome its obvious yearnings to be a feature film. The premise is cool. About a decade before, a strange light/star called Calamity showed up in the sky and soon after, ordinary humans started to develop super powers. Along with great power, these Epics acquired an inclination for megalomania. Basically, all the suped-up humans became supervillains. A few people, The Faithful, believe that a good Epic will someday save the day. Steelheart begins in a bank building in Chicago, where a much-younger David and his father are about to have a fateful encounter with Steelheart, an invincible Epic who can transform non-living substances to steel. The encounter leaves nearly everyone in the building, including David's father, dead, but not before David's father somehow wounds Steelheart. ""I've seen Steelheart bleed."" Through a bit of dumb luck, David survives and grows up in the transformed world of the Epics, where chaos reigns, and where what little order that exists is due in part to Steelheart's iron grip (heh) on the city of Chicago. David carries the secret of Steelheart's possible Achilles's heel and is driven by the overwhelming desire to avenge his father's death. When word comes that The Reckoners, a shadowy group of freedom fighters who kill Epics, have come to town, David makes it his mission to joy them. As one might guess, he joins the team, meets Megan, the girl of his dreams, and stuff blows up in a manner that feels like something straight from a director's notes. It's fun. But it's also superficial. David falls into insta-lust with Megan, the supermodel gorgeous girl, who as per formula is perpetually bitchy and humorless. (Apparently, strong women can't be funny.) All the supporting characters are one-note but I found Megan's character especially annoying because his relationship with her drives his character arc. The relationship forces David to think about something (or someone) other than revenge. In short, it should deepen his characterization. Except Megan is utterly ""bleh,"" and David's fixation no more than a teen crush, which gave me no reason to care about either character. In fact her death was a high point for me, because it meant the end of their painfully forced romance. And no more of Megan's two expressions: scowling or blank face. Anyway, despite my issues with this book, I haven't given up on Sanderson. Mostly because I have another of his novels on my Kindle. Bought it; must read it. My impression is that Steelheart isn't the best entry point into his writing.",3,fantasy,"['read', 'like', 'novelization', 'michael', 'bay', 'movie', 'like', 'transformers', 'admittedly', 'well', 'standard', 'element', 'teen', 'boy', 'michael', 'bay', 'film', 'absurdly', 'hot', 'girl', 'love_interest', 'absurdly', 'bitchy', 'awkward', 'teen', 'boy', 'despite', 'awkward', 'bit', 'larry', 'stu', 'love', 'good', 'guy', 'possess', 'mad', 'skillz', 'secondary_character', 'quickly', 'sketch', 'archetype', 'plucky', 'comic', 'relief', 'sage', 'warrior', 'tech', 'wizard', 'team', 'leader', 'mysterious', 'past', 'story', 'give', 'convenient', 'regard', 'characterization', 'state', 'team', 'member', 'know', 'risk', 'capture', 'death', 'big', 'explosion', 'car', 'chase', 'thing', 'action', 'y', 'order', 'story', 'pg', 'rate', 'expletive', 'limit', 'lame', 'lame', 'lame', 'word', 'like', 'spark', 'calamity', 'course', 'unlike', 'bay', 'sanderson', 'intentionally', 'overtly', 'serve', 'audience', 'shit', 'sandwich', 'laugh', 'dig', 'brown', 'gooey', 'feast', 'steelheart', 'heart', 'overcome', 'obvious', 'yearning', 'feature', 'film', 'premise', 'cool', 'decade', 'strange', 'light', 'star', 'call', 'calamity', 'show', 'sky', 'soon', 'ordinary', 'human', 'start', 'develop', 'super', 'power', 'great', 'power', 'epics', 'acquire', 'inclination', 'megalomania', 'basically', 'sup', 'human', 'supervillain', 'people', 'faithful', 'believe', 'good', 'epic', 'someday', 'save', 'day', 'steelheart', 'begin', 'bank', 'building', 'chicago', 'young', 'david_father', 'fateful', 'encounter', 'steelheart', 'invincible', 'epic', 'transform', 'non', 'living', 'substance', 'steel', 'encounter', 'leave', 'nearly', 'building', 'include', 'david_father', 'dead', 'david_father', 'wound', 'steelheart', 'see', 'steelheart', 'bleed', 'bit', 'dumb', 'luck', 'david', 'survive', 'grow', 'transform', 'world', 'epics', 'chaos', 'reign', 'little', 'order', 'exist', 'steelheart', 'iron', 'grip', 'heh', 'city', 'chicago', 'david', 'carry', 'secret', 'steelheart', 'possible', 'achilles', 'heel', 'drive', 'overwhelming', 'desire', 'avenge', 'father_death', 'word', 'come', 'reckoners', 'shadowy', 'group', 'freedom', 'fighter', 'kill', 'epics', 'come', 'town', 'david', 'make', 'mission', 'joy', 'guess', 'join', 'team', 'meet', 'megan', 'girl', 'dream', 'stuff', 'blow', 'manner', 'feel', 'like', 'straight', 'director', 'note', 'fun', 'superficial', 'david', 'fall', 'insta', 'lust', 'megan', 'supermodel', 'gorgeous', 'girl', 'formula', 'perpetually', 'bitchy', 'humorless', 'apparently', 'strong', 'woman', 'funny', 'supporting', 'character', 'note', 'find', 'megan', 'character', 'especially', 'annoying', 'relationship', 'drive', 'character', 'arc', 'relationship', 'force', 'david', 'think', 'revenge', 'short', 'deepen', 'characterization', 'megan', 'utterly', 'bleh', 'david', 'fixation', 'teen', 'crush', 'give', 'reason', 'care', 'character', 'fact', 'death', 'high', 'point', 'mean', 'end', 'painfully', 'forced', 'romance', 'megan', 'expression', 'scowl', 'blank', 'face', 'despite', 'issue', 'book', 'give', 'sanderson', 'novel', 'kindle', 'buy', 'read', 'impression', 'steelheart', 'good', 'entry', 'point', 'writing']"
132,"My Rating: 4.5/5 stars I loved that Changeless shows what happens after the ""happily ever after."" Readers are given a pretty good look at what married life looks for Alexia and Maccon and let me tell you that it is just as steamy and full of bickering as their courtship. It is refreshing to go into a series where the romance ends in marriage in the first book, but the story continues and deals with some of the complications of married life. This is very much a side plot, so don't be worried that the romance completely takes over. THOUGH THAT ENDING!! I'm not going to lie and say that I didn't expect a baby at some point (because I have read Prudence), but I was a bit pissed at the way Maccon took it. What I really enjoy about this series is the way that plots to kill, spies, discoveries about the world/paranormals, and the etiquette of the time all interact. I just find it funny how Alexia doesn't really care if people are trying to kill her... everything is just handled in stride. It's like the dramatics are set aside (though they definitely still exist through Miss Hesslepenny) when the important things happen. And there are just so many twists and overlapping motives/plot lines. While some of the twisty elements were slightly predictable, others were surprising and sometimes the way things are revealed isn't exactly the way you might think it would be. As a series, these books have done a good job of wrapping up enough mysterious elements to be satisfied with how a book concluded, but then leaving enough things unresolved to be compelled to read the next book. Bottom Line: This series is so refreshing for me because while it isn't young adult (Alexia is in her later twenties), it is just as compelling to read as some of my favorite young adult series. I just love how the paranormal, historical fiction, steampunk, and romance all collide. It's definitely a genre bending kind of series, and I've loved every minute of it. I think it's the best kind of crossover book for adults who love YA, but would like a steamier book with an excellent urban fantasy plot.This review was originally posted on A Bottomless Book Bag",4,fantasy,"['rating_star', 'love', 'changeless', 'show', 'happen', 'happily', 'reader', 'give', 'pretty', 'good', 'look', 'married', 'life', 'look', 'alexia', 'maccon', 'let', 'tell', 'steamy', 'bickering', 'courtship', 'refreshing', 'series', 'romance', 'end', 'marriage', 'book', 'story', 'continue', 'deal', 'complication', 'married', 'life', 'plot', 'worried', 'romance', 'completely', 'take', 'ending', 'go', 'lie', 'expect', 'baby', 'point', 'read', 'prudence', 'bit', 'pissed', 'way', 'maccon', 'take', 'enjoy', 'series', 'way', 'plot', 'kill', 'spy', 'discovery', 'world', 'paranormal', 'etiquette', 'time', 'interact', 'find', 'funny', 'alexia', 'care', 'people', 'try', 'kill', 'handle', 'stride', 'like', 'dramatic', 'set', 'aside', 'definitely', 'exist', 'miss', 'hesslepenny', 'important', 'thing', 'happen', 'twist', 'overlap', 'motive', 'plot', 'line', 'twisty', 'element', 'slightly', 'predictable', 'surprising', 'way', 'thing', 'reveal', 'exactly', 'way', 'think', 'series', 'book', 'good_job', 'wrap', 'mysterious', 'element', 'satisfy', 'book', 'conclude', 'leave', 'thing', 'unresolved', 'compel', 'read', 'book', 'line', 'series', 'refreshing', 'young_adult', 'alexia', 'later', 'twenty', 'compelling', 'read', 'favorite', 'young_adult', 'series', 'love', 'paranormal', 'historical_fiction', 'steampunk', 'romance', 'collide', 'definitely', 'genre', 'bend', 'kind', 'series', 'love', 'minute', 'think', 'good', 'kind', 'crossover', 'book', 'adult', 'love', 'ya', 'like', 'steamy', 'book', 'excellent', 'urban', 'fantasy', 'plot', 'review_originally', 'post', 'bottomless', 'book', 'bag']"
133,"Okay, I'm going to start off this review by saying I'm a linguistics major (one of two majors) at uni. This means I know my basic phonetics, phonology, syntax, semantics, morphology, sociolinguistics, etc. I don't expect anyone else who has read this book to know any of the above, nor that they're a linguist themselves. So bear with me when I get to a certain part. Also, I apologise for the length of this review. You can tell me to shut up next time, guys. Shadow and Bone is about an orphan girl named Alina who has a special power that may help save Ravka from a section of darkness called the Shadow Fold (or the Unsea) that cuts across Ravka. Or in layman's terms: girl has special power, destined to save realm. I'm going to be reviewing this in sections (not because I have a lot to say for each, just so that I can collect my thoughts in some sort of cohesive manner). Alina Alina is an orphan who grows up under the guardianship of a duke, Keramsov, with a bunch of other orphans. I have minor issues with Alina, which I'll get to, but the biggest issue I have is that she is practically without personality. When I truly and honestly think about it, I can't really describe much about her because there isn't much to her, even though she's the ""saviour"" and whatnot. She's not really a character that I'm rooting for because I like her so much; I'm rooting for her because she's trying to do the right thing. Other problems I have: - Alina, though we are told wasn't treated that much different than a peasant and had to do chores at the Duke's house, pays zero attention to any of the servants when she is taken to the palaces. You'd think she'd feel badly for them or sympathize with them, but no and no. Basically, they don't exist for her, which is odd because she was in the same kind of position back in the day. - She also speaks her mind or with snark, even to people who rank much higher than her or are more powerful than her. Except she's also inconsistent with this. She's all fire-and-brimstone, let's-be-sardonic when it comes to the Darkling (who she has often said frightens her), but as soon as she's near the King and someone speaks ill of him, she's all, ""Holy crap, that's treason!"" WHAT. - Alina sometimes comes across as entitled, especially for an orphan who's ashamed of being an orphan. Sometimes she says things, and I'm just like, ""Gurl, you should just be happy you have that, etc."" - Finally, she's the weak and clumsy female protagonist that we always seem to get in mainstream YA these days. Of course, she's weak, tired and clumsy because she's been suppressing her power for her entire life and gets better when she finally lets it out, but still. And seeing how she's in the Army, I don't see how they could even let her serve with that kind of ineptitude. (I know she's a mapmaker, but they don't keep people who have no training/they train all the personnel.) Females Hoo, boy. There are three kinds of female characters in this book: the beautiful ones (who tend to be Grisha), the ones who want to be beautiful and try really hard to be with what is basically magical cosmetic surgery, and the (assumed) plain ones (because nothing about them is mentioned). The Beautiful Ones This group of ladies encompasses only the Grisha. Alina keeps telling us that only Grisha are sexy, sexy babes so she can't be because she is Plain Jane . Okay, but these pretty people are not only ""special"" because of their magical powers, they are also horrible. Zoya, a minor character who shows up a couple of times, is hot stuff, but she is only there to be disdainful and snobbish. We also have two female summoners who are also (in Alina's words) ""snobbish"" and talk shit behind people's backs. Alina seems to have no regard for these women, she is either jealous or spiteful or blase towards them. The Ones who Want to Be Beautiful This group consists of the Queen and her cronies lackeys handmaids? Whatever they are, they didn't think they were beautiful before so they got a Grisha to fix up their faces. These people are not fun either; typically envious of the beauty of others and force Genya (the Grisha that fixes them up) to only beautify them. The Plain Ones Who knows, we don't get to hear anything about them. They essentially aren't worth note, but I assume they're all genuinely nice people. The Exception We have one exception to the three categories of female characters here: Genya. She's naturally beautiful, but chooses to adjust her face with her own powers to perfect it. She's super sweet, confident, incredibly helpful and sassy in a fun way. She's Alina's BFF in the palace and  how nice that we're seeing a great person who also is beautiful. What a change! But guess what? Genya is in love with a gangly, lean dude and everyone hates her because she uses her powers to fix faces. Head-desk. The Darkling I am honestly confused as to what kind of vibe Bardugo was trying to give off with him. What I was getting up until chapter 14 was that he was an old (but still young-looking and hot), wise, mentor-type guy who felt like he was modeled after Dumbledore but failed at it. That's really what I thought. And then he flirted with Alina and groped her palm and kissed her and I was physically disgusted and mentally dry-heaved a bit. I've seen from some other reviews that people love this guy. I don't. Maybe because he wasn't the kind of character (villain)  that I like -- I like mine charismatic and crazy (basically, Loki or the Joker), but I would never want to make out with/bone either of them . Botkin Botkin is the weapons/combat trainer for the Grisha and he comes from the Shu Han (what is essentially Northern China/Mongolia). He is a goddamn caricature of an East Asian. Normally, I'm fairly used to East Asians portrayed as kung fu/karate geniuses and having bad accents in Hollywood or mainstream TV in North America -- though I do want to thank The Walking Dead for making Glen the complete opposite of that. I admit I've become complacent with it because it doesn't seem to be stopping anytime soon and getting riled up doesn't feel worth my time. (I should mention that although I have one of the whitest names of all time, I am in fact half-Chinese and have grown up with a large Chinese cultural influence.) I make an exception for Shadow and Bone because I can't even explain in ALL CAPS how much of a slap to the face this debasement was -- it depressed me more than it angered me. It made no sense: the Fjerdan characters (based on linguistic data, I'm guessing Scandinavian) could speak Ravkan with no problems, just a teeny accent. Botkin, the only real Shu Han character (if you can call him that), gets the choppy syntax and the shitty verb morphology. He's also seen as a brute. That is not okay. Writing Not too bad for a debut author, but some of the things I read should have been edited to hell and back. e.g. ""The Apparat was looming over me, his flat black pupils lit with peculiar intensity."" ""The cold was like a hand, gripping my body in a relentless, icy grip as I tumbled through the water."" I can see my TAs scribbling ""awk"" beside those. The last thing about the writing is the boo-urns tone shift at the beginning and end. The prologue and the epilogue are third-person and the main narrative is first-person, but the tone overall was so drastic a shift that I was like, ""Huh? What? I don't know if I like this."" I got used to it though, so it clearly wasn't that big a deal; it was just jarring. Linguist Says No In the Acknowledgements, Bardugo writes that she did some research on Russian culture because Shadow and Bone is based on it. I don't think she did enough, if at all. The fifth page in we get the first of her mistakes: Alina's last name. It's Starkov. I've never studied Russian nor do I know much about Russia, but even I know that female last names have -a endings. Because of this misstep, I decided to research a couple of things myself. I got this out of it: - Ilya, a name given to a lady (based on the last name -- which does have an -a ending -- what?!) is actually a male given name, meaning ""My God is He"". Just because it ends in -a doesn't mean it's automatically a female name. - kvas, I assume, is based on kvass and isn't classified as alcoholic because there is less than 1.2% alcohol. So why do the Ravkans get super drunk on it all the time? Wouldn't it just have been better to say they were downing vodka the whole time? (This leads me to mention that a lot of the Ravkans are straight-up stereotypes of Russians: drink a lot, dress for cold weather and prickly dudes.) - Russians from the interwebz have said that the name Ana Kuya, a super minor character, means ""Why the fuck?"" when pronounced. No Russian or speaker of Russian will ever take that seriously. (Upside, I know a Russian swear word now!) - Lastly, one Grisha is named Marie. Marie is not a normal Russian given name. There are like ten different variations of Mary in Russian (e.g. Maria, Marija, Marika, Mariya, Mura, Manya, etc. ), but Bardugo gave this character a predominantly Czech/Danish/Norwegian/German/French name. It sticks out like a sore thumb. (All my info came from a quick Google search.) The linguist in me weeps for this misuse of language. I know this won't bother those of you who don't speak/are not Russian or linguists, but it bothered me, so there you go. Things I Did Like Now, you may look at this lengthy, most likely boring review and say to yourself, ""Why did you give it three stars since you wank on and on about it so much? Sounds like you hate it!"" Well, you're wrong; I liked it. I thought the plot was good, I didn't think the story dragged (even though there was a large chunk of the book that was basically Harry Potter at Hogwarts)  and the main romantic interest was neither a douchebag nor (grossly) possessive. Huzzah! Actually, I really liked the romance (not the deflated love triangle that wasn't really a love triangle) . I thought it was cute and developed well. I still had some small problems with it, which I won't go into detail here, but I could bypass those easily. And I loved that the romance wasn't a central part of the story. The story was about Alina growing into her power and self, not some sappy, make-me-roll-my-eyes-until-they-fall-out kind of story. I also liked how it ended (even though I thought the ending was a little rushed). And it wasn't on some dumb cliffhanger! Nothing makes me happier than a book that wraps itself up even if the entire series plot arc isn't over. I know the last section is minimal compared to the above critiques, but there really isn't another way I can say I liked this book, problems and all. I can only say that I will definitely be reading the second one in this series and I'm crossing my fingers that it gets better and kicks more ass.",3,fantasy,"['okay', 'go', 'start', 'review', 'say',

135,"At first, I was a little skeptical of the tone of the book because it just felt like a darker version of Good Omens. And it was to a certain extent (I can now more clearly divide the Pratchett whimsicality from the Gaiman somberness in that book). But it was definitely an independent entity that I found myself really enjoying. It almost felt like I was reading a cleverly entwined Stephen King plot, and that's something that I've never really experienced in a Gaiman book before. The concept behind the book was intriguing. Instead of gods being controlling, all-powerful beings, they're only strong when they have the faith of followers. Otherwise, they can weaken and even fall from existence given enough time and neglect. I thought it was really cool to also see how gods from various cultures were now being pitted against gods of the new world (e.g. media, internet, stock markets). Shadow was such a cool character - compliant and malleable but still strong willed and tenacious. I think he was a big reason that I enjoyed the book so much. Overall, it was just a really satisfying story with a nice balance between character development and plot escalation. There were a few small things that didn't tie up as nicely (Shadow gave one rousing speech and completely stopped the war that had been brewing for the whole book? Okay...)  but it was still really enjoyable.",5,fantasy,"['little', 'skeptical', 'tone', 'book', 'feel', 'like', 'dark', 'version', 'good', 'omens', 'certain', 'extent', 'clearly', 'divide', 'pratchett', 'whimsicality', 'gaiman', 'somberness', 'book', 'definitely', 'independent', 'entity', 'find', 'enjoy', 'feel', 'like', 'read', 'cleverly', 'entwine', 'stephen_king', 'plot', 'experience', 'gaiman', 'book', 'concept', 'book', 'intriguing', 'instead', 'god', 'control', 'powerful', 'being', 'strong', 'faith', 'follower', 'weaken', 'fall', 'existence', 'give', 'time', 'neglect', 'think', 'cool', 'god', 'culture', 'pit', 'god', 'new', 'world', 'medium', 'internet', 'stock', 'market', 'shadow', 'cool', 'character', 'compliant', 'malleable', 'strong_willed', 'tenacious', 'think', 'big', 'reason', 'enjoy', 'book', 'overall', 'satisfying', 'story', 'nice', 'balance', 'character_development', 'plot', 'escalation', 'small', 'thing', 'tie', 'nicely', 'shadow', 'give', 'rousing', 'speech', 'completely', 'stop', 'war', 'brew', 'book', 'okay', 'enjoyable']"

137,"I wasn't in love with Halo but I liked it enough to give Hades a try and I gotta say I'm happy I did! Hades was a much better story because the pacing was perfect. Things didn't move too fast and I found myself happy with Bethany's character. I must admit that things happening in Hades didn't really add up for me. The way Jake handled Bethany didn't seem right. He's a demon so I thought he would have done more to her, even if it was against her will. I also thought that Bethany being able to communicate with Xavier was really cute but it didn't seem like that should be happening and I thought it was kind of annoying that she could. Don't get me wrong I'm glad she could but I don't like it when the main characters always can do these extraordinary things. I remember reading a description that made me think I would judge Xavier's loyalty or not, but I honestly never did. I understand he got upset and Ivy and Gabriel had to set him straight sometimes, but I think for a teenage boy that's normal. What I was not expecting was the whole Gabriel and Molly thing. I'm really anxious to read about them in the Heaven! Overall, I found myself really liking the book and I liked that we got to see a lot more of Bethany's family, Ivy and Gabriel. They're nice characters to read about and I'm glad we learned more about them. I must say I definitely didn't see that ending coming and I don't really think it made sense - Xavier never acts so spontaneous like that.

138,"A great addition to the Eugenides storyline! Full of the usual twists and turns you've come to expect from these books, I did guess some of them, but not others so there were still fun surprises to be had. It did not conclude the story though, so I imagine there will be another one along one of these years. ;) We once again get a view into what's happening in Attolia with the kind and queen, which is always nice, brief though it was. I liked seeing Eugenides holding court from Kemet's point of view and how he is making a reputation for himself among his own people for being so clever and ingenious. Much better than when they thought he was an idiot. I also liked how he finally worked out the sand in his food dilemma. It was interesting to learn more about the Mede Empire that we've had looming over the story for the last several books and to get some more insight into Kemet's character as well. I almost wondered if she was trying to do a romance thing with her bromance between the Attolian and Kemet given that I know she writes some novels with alternative lifestyles. There was enough there I think that if you were looking for that kind of romance you'd find it, but if you weren't you'd just assume they were good friends. I'm wondering who the mysterious ""southern gentleman"" was that kept helping them. Was it really Ennikar? I wasn't sure if he was a god or not... also liked how the god at the well said to Remember Ennikar and Pay the fastener...then the escaped slave who helped them was named Godeker which meant fastener...

139,"3.5 stars. Good sequel. I especially loved the developments with Dorian. He seems to be a much different person in this book and I LIKE it! Here are my two gripes:  We don't have enough background/info to understand WHY Chaol is so loyal to that treacherous king. We are left wanting to punch him in the face because he keeps putting the king first, and the king is obviously enemy #1. Why does Chaol, who is otherwise a good man, want to serve that viper? If there were some sort of backstory to explain it (like maybe the king saved his homeland Arielle from those crazy mountain madmen; that would work) we would have felt the conflict within Chaol MUCH more. Instead we just scream in our minds for him to stop causing problems because of his dumb loyalty! Okay, second gripe. If Celeaena is such an amazing assassin, WHY DOESN'T SHE EVER TRY TO KILL HER ONE TRUE ENEMY (the King)? The whole purpose of her existence is to defeat him, and yet she doesn't ever explain why she can't use her chosen career to get the job done? The author again could have put some work into creating why that wouldn't be plausible (maybe the King's magic ring makes him immune to poison makes it so he doesn't need sleep--I don't know). Good pace throughout; Celaena is still bloodthirsty and the big reveal at the end we could see coming all along, but it was still exciting.

141,"Full Review & More - Paws and Paperbacks ARC received through NetGalley. A lot of people have raved about Gilded Cage, but I, for one, couldn't figure out what all the hype was about. First of all, this book was much different than what I had expected. I'll dive into more on that later but I think that was a big part of my dislike, along with high expectations due to all the raving five star review (when will I learn? Gilded Cage is a dystopian novel, but what sets it apart from all the other YA dystopian novels is the plot. Not only is it intricate and complex, but it's different-a good different. The world building was strong. It took me a while to get used to this type of dystopian world, similar to how I was when I read Red Queen, but once I got into it I was impressed by the world the author had built. One issue I had was the pacing of the book. At one point, less than three-quarters of the way, I realized that six months had already passed since the start. Six months, and yet I knew absolutely nothing about most of the characters, including Abi, who I had assumed was one of the main protagonists. I was 75% done with the book and had only read two chapters from her POV and had no clue what her storyline was or anything about her character. The combination of the pacing and the multiple POVs led me to feel unconnected to any of the characters and like I was reading about strangers the entire time. The one character I did really appreciate was Gavar. He seemed the most complex, and his struggles were interesting and complicated. I wanted to read more and more from his perspective. He is clearly going to end up as some sort of antihero and I could not be more on board. There's definitely more to him than we know and I'm dying to know more about what happened between him and Leah. Also, his love for his daughter, Libby, was so pure and precious. Especially considering how easy it would be to despise her. If I continue with the series, it will be for Gavar alone. The romance was basically nonexistent. It's not usually a deal breaker for me unless the story is lacking, which I thought it was. I thought I would be all about the Abi/Jenner pairing, but I honestly wasn't all the involved in their story. Probably because it was very rushed and there was way too much telling instead of showing. The romance was basically nonexistent. It's not usually a deal breaker for me unless the story is lacking, which I thought it was. I thought I would be all about the Abi/Jenner pairing, but I honestly wasn't all the involved in their story. Probably because it was very rushed and there was way too much telling instead of showing. All of a sudden there were these intense feelings between them, but since we only had Abi's POV two or three times throughout the whole book, we never get to see any conversations or interactions between them, and never get the chance to see these feelings develop. And now the thing that bothered me the most: I felt so misled going into this. This was a very different story than what the synopsis suggested. Don't get me wrong: the plot is strong and unique, but it was not at all what I was expecting to read. I get more in depth about this on my blog. All in all, unfortunately I wasn't too impressed by the book. I gave it an extra star because the basics of the plot were pretty interesting and different from the usual young adult dystopian books, and also because Gavar.",2,fantasy,"['review', 'paws', 'paperbacks', 'arc', 'receive', 'netgalley', 'lot', 'people', 'rave', 'gilded', 'cage', 'figure', 'hype', 'book', 'different', 'expect', 'dive', 'later', 'think', 'big', 'dislike', 'high_expectation', 'rave', 'star', 'review', 'learn', 'gilded', 'cage', 'dystopian', 'novel', 'set', 'apart', 'ya', 'dystopian', 'novel', 'plot', 'intricate', 'complex', 'different', 'good', 'different', 'world_building', 'strong', 'take', 'type', 'dystopian', 'world', 'similar', 'read', 'red_queen', 'get', 'impress', 'world', 'author', 'build', 'issue', 'pacing', 'book', 'point', 'quarter', 'way', 'realize', 'month', 'pass', 'start', 'month', 'know', 'absolutely', 'character', 'include', 'abi', 'assume', 'main', 'protagonist', 'book', 'read', 'chapter', 'pov', 'clue', 'storyline', 'character', 'combination', 'pacing', 'multiple', 'pov', 'lead', 'feel', 'unconnected', 'character', 'like', 'read', 'stranger', 'entire', 'time', 'character', 'appreciate', 'gavar', 'complex', 'struggle', 'interesting', 'complicated', 'want', 'read', 'perspective', 'clearly', 'go', 'end', 'sort', 'antihero', 'board', 'definitely', 'know', 'die', 'know', 'happen', 'leah', 'love', 'daughter', 'libby', 'pure', 'precious', 'especially', 'consider', 'easy', 'despise', 'continue', 'series', 'gavar', 'romance', 'basically', 'nonexistent', 'usually', 'deal', 'breaker', 'story', 'lack', 'think', 'think', 'abi', 'jenner', 'pairing', 'honestly', 'involved', 'story', 'probably', 'rushed', 'way', 'telling_instead', 'showing', 'romance', 'basically', 'nonexistent', 'usually', 'deal', 'breaker', 'story', 'lack', 'think', 'think', 'abi', 'jenner', 'pairing', 'honestly', 'involved', 'story', 'probably', 'rushed', 'way', 'telling_instead', 'showing', 'sudden', 'intense', 'feeling', 'abi', 'pov', 'time', 'book', 'conversation', 'interaction', 'chance', 'feeling', 'develop', 'thing', 'bother', 'feel', 'misled', 'go', 'different', 'story', 'synopsis', 'suggest', 'wrong', 'plot', 'strong', 'unique', 'expect', 'read', 'depth', 'blog', 'unfortunately', 'impress', 'book', 'give', 'extra', 'star', 'basic', 'plot', 'pretty', 'interesting', 'different', 'usual', 'young_adult', 'dystopian', 'book', 'gavar']"
142,"I was happy with the verbose prose. I rather enjoyed the descriptions and world-building actually. And ahhh an oriental setting mixed with fantasy mixed with steampunk = YES! The highlight in this novel was, without a doubt, Buruu and Yukiko's relationship and their funny conversations together. Yukiko's strained relationship with her father was well-done and made my heart ache a little heh. The plot was interesting until Yukiko goes to court... and then it became boring. There was no political intrigue... just Yukiko swooning over Green Eyes...   and I don't even want to think about the romance in this novel... it was awful. Ok, I'll think a bit about it. Firstly - instalust (CRINGE) for random soldier just because of his eyes (ok admittedly green eyes are nice but) there is ZERO CHEMISTRY BETWEEN Green Eyes and Yukiko. A bad romance is just completely off-putting to me. Now, if Green Eyes wasn't a love interest, and it was ONLY Kin, then that I could bear with. A slow build-up from friendship in the sky ship, to betrayal at finding out his identity, then eventually slow buds of romance *sighs happily*  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. And unfortunately, I'm not in the mood to tolerate even a hint of a love triangle right now. The villain. Yoritomo. Kristoff did a good job at making me feel absolute disgust for him. But... I find it really difficult to believe a 13 year old madman/boy could stay on the throne for so many years without his unhappy courtiers or even the guild already disposing of him.

145,"The long synopsis doesn't do justice to the book. The Name of the Wind is a unique novel, a triumphant debut from a hither-to unknown author. The level of mastery the author has displayed is rarely found in a debut novel, and in this light, I like the novel very much. When judging the book by the hype that surrounds it, however, I find it lacking. it is slow to start, and Kvothe's motivation for revealing his story to the Chronicler is is surprising given the effort he has put into disappearing. In this way, I found the set up of the novel, a story within a story, is executed well after this point, but getting there seems sloppy. Once Kvothe starts telling his story, however, it is difficult not to lose yourself. He is a masterful story-teller, and Rothfuss has captured his 'voice' well. His adventures make you want to laugh, cry, rage at the fates, and generally capture your imagination. The narrative does have a few lulls and slow points but for the most part it is riveting and carries you along like the swift current of a river. I like Kvothe a lot - he is a good protagonist and narrator. Hearing a man tell of his journey from boyhood to adulthood is always exciting, and Kvothe doesn't hold anything back. He is brutally honest about his experiences and feelings, allowing the reader to empathise with him easily. He does keep saying things like ""If you haven't experienced this, then you don't really know / can't imagine what it's like"" which sounds very patronising. I also didn't understand why Kvothe, being familiar with poverty, would squander what little money he has without any thought. He should have learnt to save some money for hard times, but no, he keeps spending it and finding himself at the edge of poverty frequently. With the notable exception of Denna, there are no exciting female characters in the book, and certainly no strong ones. Even Rela only makes it into the story when she is needed for a plot device, and otherwise largely ignored by both Kvothe and the author. Denna and Kvothe strike me as the only two fully fleshed out characters, while the others are pigeon-holed into stereo-typical roles, to be pulled out when the plot requires. The Name of the Wind is certainly worth a read, and if you like fantasy then you really can't miss it. Patrick Rothfuss has proved that he is a force to be reckoned with. I have the second book of the trilogy already, and will be diving into it eagerly at the next available opportunity.

146,"This book was amazing. It had everything I wanted: lots of danger and injury and desperate wanting and angst and a different paranormal take and very good writing and an excellent plot and strong, individual characters and conflict and on and on. I LOVED it! If you like M/M paranormal romances, go read it. This one is fabulous. I liked that they used a condom even for oral sex. That's important and so many books omit that part. I really like how Leif puts Dan's father's death into perspective. (medium spoiler) He doesn't blame the depression or condemn the man for suicide; he says, ""The man had a responsibility to his kids, and if he couldn't live up to it, it was his duty to get some help and not lay it on you."" He also says that he usually doesn't judge suicides. I'm the first person to defend the suicidal but I, as a mother who has been suicidal in the past, completely agree with Leif here. It's so refreshing to read about a character who is mad at the right things not at the disease itself. I really hated but liked, too, because it was realistic, that (big spoiler) Leif's body responds to an evil ex-lover because he used to love him. I particularly hated that we hear this several times. Only once was necessary, but in places the author goes into WAY too much detail and I was really upset. It was awesome how when going into danger, Dan didn't promise that he would be back but that he would try his best. I hate when characters promise things they have little control over. Nitpicks (because what is a Kelly review without them? ): Virgil is grounded at one point then the next day or so is still allowed to go out. The dead have flesh hanging from them, even if they've been dead for a century and a half, such as a confederate soldier. With only the burial technology available then, the body would be completely decomposed other than the bones. One bad guy is able to do something that an equally powerful bad guy with the same resources wasn't able to do in the past. But forget those silly things because the book is so good. Five plus stars.

148,"I feel like I have some explaining to do. As a true potterhead I admit that my expectations towards this book were way through the roof, so the disappointment was inevitable. This is NOT the eight Harry Potter book, firstly because it is a play, and without Rowling's compelling narrative style, without all the descriptions that created the truly magical atmosphere in the other books, it just doesn't resonate with the reader as the original series did. The characters are rather shallow and predictable, it is hard to identify with them as we don't get to know them as well as in the original Potter saga (which can also be explained by it being a play and not a novel), and the old characters are rather one-dimentional, for example  Ron, who seems to have very low IQ and acts like a 17 year old while being a husband of the Minister for Magic . Secondly, the whole story reads rather like a piece of fanfiction than a continuation of the saga. However, if one looks at it as fanfiction from the start, it is not all that bad. We can find a reference to Voldemort's lack of nose, a completely mental twist involving the Trolley Witch from the Hogwart's Express, time travelling and, perhaps the biggest surprise, offspring of characters whom I cannot imagine in bed without giggling.

149,"As far as I can remember, this is my favourite book in the series. *I don't remember what day it is most of the time, so that's not really reassuring I guess*Because, we get to learn about Li Lei's past! Now you may be asking yourselves, what is it so exciting about an old woman... Let me give you the spoiler She burned the sheets with a dragon. Literally... or maybe figuratively.. hmm that brings some questions. Anyways the moral of this little brainfarting is that, she did wild dragon dance with an actual dragon. . If you ever reach to that level of coolness, you'll get to turn your nose down at Li Lie. Which is never. Aside from The Grandma, there is more information about dragons and their meddling ways. And shiny lupus politics, which are quite complex in its simplicity. And silent. So basically you need to guess what others will guess you are guessing and act according to that guess, which is doing neither the opposite nor the exact actions of the guesses but finding a middle ground that makes you look both powerful and caring. Yeah... Lily is kind of irritating. She's such a stuck up, I need to have a logical reason for everything person. Which is okay in little doses but after awhile it's grating on nerves. Her voice turned into a high pitched, annoying voice in my mind. But she has her moments. Cynna is getting lovelier each book. I can't wait to see her and Cullen as parents again. They are cute.

150,"Wow! I finally was able to put 'Red Rising' down after hours of intense reading, but only after I reached the last page! This is very exciting story! While this novel is book one in a trilogy, thankfully it can be read as a standalone. It ends, though, leaving you, gentle reader, wanting to know how things are going to turn out. Similar to the YA books Divergent and The Hunger Games, 'Red Rising' teens are forced into military competitions where they must kill or be killed. They also can win big rewards if they are the last man standing if the Society overlords had not been secretly corrupted! However, I think 'Red Rising is a more sophisticated read, bringing in some metafictional themes with deeper and more adult literary references, specifically from ancient Greek and Roman literature. But if you know nothing about ancient literature, that will not be a handicap at all in enjoying the action and thrills of this science-fiction dystopia. I think 'Red Rising' is way far superior to the other novels I mentioned above which are somewhat similar but were published earlier. But those who find military strategy a bore may not enjoy 'Red Rising' since it is a primarily a thrill ride of murderous political and military games after the opening pages which introduce the reader to the harsh world of the 'Reds'. The fictional games appear to use real-world problems of leadership and team-building to me, and I enjoy seeing how such challenges allow extremely smart, and not-so-smart, individuals to operate on several psychological and military levels in demonstrating strategy skills while at the same time dealing with extreme danger. However, girl soldiers are mistreated with additional tortures common in war specifically, rape, along with the other usual dangers of combat,  , so people who get triggered will want to avoid this novel. None of the competitors are supposed to die, but the combatants are told accidental deaths cannot be avoided given the brutality they all are otherwise permitted to use in defeating each other. The novel is based in a future where artificial social classes have been created by extreme technology access. The rich - Golds - are able to manufacture very strong handsome physical bodies, while those who are without money must make do with ordinary flesh and very little food or goods - Reds. Darrow, a Red, is recently married, loves his wife Eo, and he has great hopes for his Clan. He has no idea that his life is soon to be smashed into pieces. Reds are impoverished miners who live deep inside caves and tunnels on Mars. They never see the surface of Mars and they work at the hard dangerous labor of mining without pay. Their access to goods, information, freedom of movement and education is tightly controlled, so they are unaware of how they have been manipulated into this work, or the truth about what is beyond Mars. The miners have been taught the Earth is radioactive, and the reason behind their sacrifice of starving unpaid labor is to hopefully terraform Mars one day so that cities on the surface may be built. It has been this way for 800 years.... I caution readers who dislike gore and violence, and who prefer their heroes to pick humane options first instead of expedient ones ensuring survival. Traditional morality by necessity takes a backseat to personal ambition and Big Picture goals. Many readers who are uncomfortable with Realpolitik ethics may balk at seeing the decisions which must be made by characters in this fast-paced, well-written book. Readers who enjoyed the novel Ender's Game primarily for entertainment should definitely give this novel a try; however it falls short of the literary depths Orson Scott Card reaches in his Ender series. Pierce Brown writes with greater heat and intellectual blunt force compared to Card's multi-dimensional intellectual cool. Brown's universe has considerably more of a wrong-turn-taken aspect for humanity as well.",4,fantasy,"['wow', 'finally', 'able', 'red_rising', 'hour', 'intense', 'reading', 'reach', 'page', 'exciting', 'story', 'novel', 'book', 'trilogy', 'thankfully', 'read', 'standalone', 'end', 'leave', 'gentle', 'reader', 'want', 'know', 'thing', 'go', 'turn', 'similar', 'ya', 'book', 'divergent', 'hunger_games', 'red_rising', 'teen', 'force', 'military', 'competition', 'kill', 'kill', 'win', 'big', 'reward', 'man', 'stand', 'society', 'overlord', 'secretly', 'corrupt', 'think', 'red_rising', 'sophisticated', 'read', 'bring', 'metafictional', 'theme', 'deep', 'adult', 'literary_reference', 'specifically', 'ancient', 'greek', 'roman', 'literature', 'know', 'ancient', 'literature', 'handicap', 'enjoy', 'action', 'thrill', 'science_fiction', 'dystopia', 'think', 'red_rising', 'way', 'far', 'superior', 'novel', 'mention', 'somewhat', 'similar', 'publish', 'early', 'find', 'military', 'strategy', 'bore', 'enjoy', 'red_rising', 'primarily', 'thrill', 'ride', 'murderous', 'political', 'military', 'game', 'open', 'page', 'introduce', 'reader', 'harsh', 'world', 'reds', 'fictional', 'game', 'appear', 'use', 'real', 'world', 'problem', 'leadership', 'team', 'building', 'enjoy', 'see', 'challenge', 'allow', 'extremely', 'smart', 'smart', 'individual', 'operate', 'psychological', 'military', 'level', 'demonstrate', 'strategy', 'skill', 'time', 'deal', 'extreme', 'danger', 'girl', 'soldier', 'mistreat', 'additional', 'torture', 'common', 'war', 'specifically', 'rape', 'usual', 'danger', 'combat', 'people', 'trigger', 'want', 'avoid', 'novel', 'competitor', 'suppose', 'die', 'combatant', 'tell', 'accidental', 'death', 'avoid', 'give', 'brutality', 'permit', 'use', 'defeat', 'novel', 'base', 'future', 'artificial', 'social', 'class', 'create', 'extreme', 'technology', 'access', 'rich', 'golds', 'able', 'manufacture', 'strong', 'handsome', 'physical', 'body', 'money', 'ordinary', 'flesh', 'little', 'food', 'good', 'reds', 'darrow', 'red', 'recently', 'married', 'love', 'wife', 'eo', 'great', 'hope', 'clan', 'idea', 'life', 'soon', 'smash', 'piece', 'red', 'impoverished', 'miner', 'live', 'deep', 'inside', 'cave', 'tunnel', 'mars', 'surface', 'mars', 'work', 'hard', 'dangerous', 'labor', 'mining', 'pay', 'access', 'good', 'information', 'freedom', 'movement', 'education', 'tightly', 'control', 'unaware', 'manipulate', 'work', 'truth', 'mars', 'miner', 'teach', 'earth', 'radioactive', 'reason', 'sacrifice', 'starve', 'unpaid', 'labor', 'hopefully', 'terraform', 'mars', 'day', 'city', 'surface', 'build', 'way', 'year', 'caution', 'reader', 'dislike', 'gore', 'violence', 'prefer', 'hero', 'pick', 'humane', 'option', 'instead', 'expedient', 'one', 'ensure', 'survival', 'traditional', 'morality', 'necessity', 'take', 'backseat', 'personal', 'ambition', 'big', 'picture', 'goal', 'reader', 'uncomfortable', 'realpolitik', 'ethic', 'balk', 'see', 'decision', 'character', 'fast_pace', 'write', 'book', 'reader', 'enjoy', 'novel', 'ender', 'game', 'primarily', 'entertainment', 'definitely', 'novel', 'try', 'fall', 'short', 'literary', 'depth', 'orson', 'scott', 'card', 'reach', 'ender', 'series', 'pierce', 'brown', 'write', 'great', 'heat', 'intellectual', 'blunt', 'force', 'compare', 'card', 'multi', 'dimensional', 'intellectual', 'cool', 'brown', 'universe', 'considerably', 'wrong', 'turn', 'take', 'aspect', 'humanity']"

""Then the only option is, you cannot."" I think ""bittersweet"" is the perfect word to describe this book. Both with how I feel about it, and the general tone and atmosphere of the story. Set in historical Russia, you can tell the author is passionate about the history and sticks very close to what is real, even if she adds her own twists to it. Vika, trained by her loving father Sergei, has lived a secluded life on Ovchinin Island, training to one day become Imperial Enchantress. Nikolai, an orphan from Kazakh and a fan of fashion, has also been training to become Imperial Enchanter under the wing of cold, unloving Galina. Vika and Nikolai do not know each other, and would never have believed that one day they would be battling each other in the deadly Crown's Game for the same position they both desperately want. With the Ottoman Empire and the Kazakhs threatening invasion, the Tsar needs a powerful enchanter by his side. As royal heir, Pavel Alexandrovich Romanov, known as Pasha to his friends, knows that one day he will take the throne and rule the Russian Empire. But that's not what Pasha wants, and his life is filled with frivolities as he tries to enjoy his freedom whilst he can. ""Commence the Crown's Game,"" she said as she retrieved a small but heavy chest from the hidden compartment. It looked, amazingly, like it had been painted and lacquered yesterday, as if the magic repelled dust from its shiny surface. In fact, it probably did. ""Give Russia and Imperial Enhanter, Father, so we can fight if we need to. Do it for Pasha, for his birthday, even if he does't know."" As the enchanters face-off in a once in a lifetime battle of power, Nikolai and Vika know that only one of them can live. Only one of them can end the game. At the end of the game, one of them will die. ""Tell me."" Nikolai restrained himself from reassuring her not to be afraid. He needed to know what the leaf meant. ""The jagged one represents... death. You were born of death, and..."" ""And what?"" ""And death will... follow you, always..."" The Crown's Game is very well written, steeped in history and with many details that truly brought historical Russia to life. However, it was also a let down. Maybe I'd set my expectations too high, and maybe I went into it with a one-track mentality, but I was seriously expecting assassin-like turns, where the characters would try and one-up each other at every turn, and that they would at least do their best to kill each other. But no. Instead of a battle to the death, we get very soft magic. Bearing in mind that the competitors only have five turns each before an Enchanter is chosen, I wasn't impressed by Nikolai's redecorating skills or Vika's dressmaking ones. The main problem was Vika. She was so spoilt and mean and she got on my nerves a lot of the time. So many times, in fact, that I had to put the book down after the first two chapters and really think it through. Thank God for Nikolai's and Pasha's chapters because they redeemed this novel by 110%. If it hadn't been for them, I would've probably DNFed. Vika is the sort of person who knows she's perfect and shoves it in everyone's faces. She holds herself higher than anyone else and disregards people and their talents because they're not her, and therefore not good enough. At least, that was how it felt to this reader. Although the romance is very subtle, the fact that it's suddenly there and all up in your face was the most annoying thing of all. Suddenly, after a masquerade, everyone's in love with Vika. Nikolai is, although he tries to hide it, and so is Pasha. It made for incredibly frustrating reading and didn't fit well with the rest of the novel. At least not in the way it was showcased so suddenly. However, it's not all doom and gloom! I absolutely adored Nikolai and Pasha's friendship. It truly was the kind of friendship that could have transcended ages, if it weren't for Vika getting in the way. She destroyed everything they had, and even had the gall to be upset when neither of them would look at her... Vika noticed that Pasha did not look at her. It was as if he didn't know her either. Had she imagined the past two months? The dancing at the masquerade, the near kiss in the maple grove, the carriage ride after her father's death? Everyone had forsaken her. If it's not about Vika, then it's not worth her thinking about. I really felt for Nikolai as a character. A boy borne from nothing, struggling to survive in the shadow of his best friend who also happened to be the heir of an empire, and needing to win the Game so he could one day serve and protect Pasha the way he had always dreamed. I even felt for Pasha, a boy born into royalty who wanted nothing more than to be a ""normal"" guy and enjoy life the way it is, without all the added benefits of being a prince. The two struggled in their own ways, but they always had each other, and all that is forsaken in the name of a girl who couldn't care less about either of them. Unfortunately, The Crown's Game just wasn't for me. I highly recommend it for fans of fantasy, but not fans of the Throne of Glass series who might expect something from this book that it just cannot provide. After reading: An Episode of Inside Aly's Brain! Man, I've missed writing nonsensical, ranty reviews that are more like word vomit than anything else. I will surely post a better, more coherent review once I've untangled my poor braincells. I think ""bittersweet"" is the perfect word to describe this book. Both with how I feel about it, and the general tone and atmosphere of the story. Set in historical Russia, you can tell the author is passionate about the history and sticks very close to what is real, even if she adds her own twists to it. But here's the thing, and I hate myself for it, I believe magic should not have played such a huge part. When I requested The Crown's Game it was because it promised brutality and an edge-of-your-seat story that would have my heart burst out of my chest and my eyes leak excess water. I mean, it's right there in the summary! Unfortunately, I didn't quite get that? I mean, it's weird, because it should have been that way. My expectations weren't ridiculously high, but it's the logical conclusion. Instead of a battle to the death, though, we get much magical prancing around decorating Nevsky Prospect and creating enchanted islands and benches that let you dream (which is cool, but shouldn't be a turn in a duel!). Where is my death? My heartache? Where are all the impossible decisions? I was seriously expecting assassin-like turns, where they'd try and one-up each other at every turn, and that they would at least do their best to kill each other. But no. It isn't until they're forced to that it actually happens. My main problem, I think, was Vika. She was so spoilt and mean and so lardy-dah-I-am-better-than-that-pesky-Nikolai-because-I-can-use-the-elements that I had to put the book down after the first two chapters and really think it through. Thank God for Nikolai's and Pasha's chapters because the two of them 110% redeemed this novel for me. If it hadn't been for them, I would've probably DNFed. Vika is the sort of person that knows she's perfect and shoves it in everyone's faces. She holds herself higher than anyone else and disregards people and their talents because if they're not her, they're not good enough. I may be wrong, but that's what I took from her. And okay, the romance is very subtle, but the fact that it's suddenly there and all up in your face was the most annoying thing ever. Suddenly, after a masquerade, everyone's in love with Vika. Nikolai is, although he tries to hide it, and so is Pasha, and it's so frustrating because no. Bros before hoes, or is that too much to ask for? I absolutely adored Nikolai and Pasha's friendship. It truly is the kind of friendship that could have transcended ages, if it weren't for Vika getting in the way. She destroyed everything they had, and even had the gall to be upset when neither of them would look at her? I mean, this is literally the paragraph after she thinks about how much she wants to hurl herself at Nikolai: Vika noticed that Pasha did not look at her. It was as if he didn't know her either. Had she imagined the past two months? The dancing at the masquerade, the near kiss in the maple grove, the carriage ride after her father's death? Everyone had forsaken her. NO. No one has ""forsaken"" you. They're all too busy grieving. For the love of all that is holy. I really felt for Nikolai as a character. A boy borne from nothing, struggling to survive in the shadow of his best friend who also happened to be the heir of an empire, and needing to win the Game so he could one day serve and protect Pasha the way he always wanted to. I even felt for Pasha, a boy born into royalty who wanted nothing more than to be a ""normal"" guy and to enjoy life the way it is, without all the added benefits of being a prince. The two struggled in their own ways, but they always had each other, and all that is forsaken in the name of a girl who couldn't give a rat's ass about either of them, to be completely honest. I seriously hope this isn't a standalone, because the last 20%, although way more interesting than the entire book, are not enough for me to be happy with. Selfish, I know, but I need more explanations than that. It's very rushed, and Vika is far too easily forgiven and Nikolai too easily forgotten, and that's not okay. My heart cannot deal. Please let Nikolai be alive and for him and Pasha to be BFFs again and Vika to disappear.

154,"I liked this novel, I did, but not nearly as much as the first one. The formerly self assured ball-busting Abby Sinclair is just not the same in this second installment. There is definitely more romance than in the previous novel, but I liked  A Brush of Darkness  for its Fantasy elements-not its romance. The addition of Talivar, an elven prince, as Abby's bodyguard was nice, but I never understand why authors today find they have to have two heroes fighting over the heroine. Hello? Indecisive much? Not to mention being with two guys who are not okay with one another is going to end in heartache for someone, maybe two someones. Unless you go the route of Hamilton's Anita Blake. But then again, I digress. In this novel the door to Faery is closed by the Elf Queen- who is slowly going mad. Later we find at no fault of her own, but Maurice's (bad guy from the first one). The Faeries stuck on Earth will slowly whither and die if they are continually cut off, including Moira's half angel son- Abby's young charge. So of course Abby to the rescue, along with some of her friends. Abby finds out the truth about her origins and it's a shocking discovery that she takes in stride. She ends up in Faery and learns that sacrifices will be made and hearts indeed broken... at least until the third novel. ----> I'll leave it at that so if you want to find out- you gotta get the book.",4,fantasy,"['like', 'novel', 'nearly', 'self', 'assured', 'ball', 'bust', 'abby', 'sinclair', 'second', 'installment', 'definitely', 'romance', 'previous', 'novel', 'like', 'brush', 'darkness', 'fantasy', 'element', 'romance', 'addition', 'talivar', 'elven', 'prince', 'abby', 'bodyguard', 'nice', 'understand', 'author', 'today', 'find', 'hero', 'fight', 'heroine', 'hello', 'indecisive', 'mention', 'guy', 'okay', 'go', 'end', 'heartache', 'maybe', 'someone', 'route', 'hamilton', 'anita', 'blake', 'digress', 'novel', 'door', 'faery', 'close', 'elf', 'slowly', 'go', 'mad', 'later', 'find', 'fault', 'maurice', 'bad_guy', 'faeries', 'stick', 'earth', 'slowly', 'die', 'continually', 'cut', 'include', 'moira', 'half', 'angel', 'abby', 'young', 'charge', 'course', 'abby', 'rescue', 'friend', 'abby', 'find', 'truth', 'origin', 'shocking', 'discovery', 'take', 'stride', 'end', 'faery', 'learn', 'sacrifice', 'heart_break', 'novel', 'leave', 'want', 'find', 'got_to', 'book']"

156,Brandon Sanderson is quickly establishing himself in my head as one of the best fantasy authors alive. He has incredibly detailed magic systems in all of his books. His characters actually develop and while so you learn with them.

157,"I love this book. Usually, I can't think of anything to say for any of the books on my favorites shelf, mostly because they leave me speechless. This is no exception, but I'll give it a shot. So. Each one of the installments in The Queen's Thief series revolves around a different theme; The Thief was an adventure, while its sequel, The Queen of Attolia, is about the politics of love and war. The King of Attolia, however, is about hidden depths, and things that are not what they appear to be. It's also about loyalty and trust; specifically, how Eugenides, the former Thief of Eddis, earns the loyalty of the court of Attolia. It's a bumpy ride: with silly pranks, more serious conspiracies, gossip, hatred and prejudice at every turn, Eugenides has dug himself a hole too deep to manipulate his way out of. Or has he? Gen is an amazingly complex character, who appears on the outside to be inept, foolish, and weak; an idiot who in every way is unfit to be king. He falls asleep in court meetings. He can't handle his own misbehaving attendants. He refuses to punish even the man who hit him in the jaw out of rage. The court calls him the ""one-handed goatfoot who abducted the queen and stole her throne,"" because they know nothing about him. They don't know how wrong they are: he's a cunning chessmaster who knows exactly how to make them bow down, using careful planning, negotiations and mercy instead of his queen's preferred executions. In the course of time, Eugenides proves to each and every one of them what a king and warrior he can be. But he doesn't narrate these revelations. The narrative of this novel is given to one of his personal subjects, a guardsman named Costis. I suspect this is a tool to let the readers see inside Eugenides and his wife Attolias' personal life while still giving them privacy, but it's all fine to me. As much as I love the romance of Gen and Irene,(Falling in love with someone who hates you, and staying in love even after she tortured you by cutting your hand off while you were only a boy? Or worse, falling in love with someone after you cut his hand off? If that doesn't make for a complicated relationship, I don't know what does.) I know it's dancing on the line between young adult fiction and children's fiction to give us more than the few sweet kisses we get. I heard there's two more books upcoming after the fourth - titled A Conspiracy of Kings - and I hope to see more of this interesting and complex pair. Megan Whalen Turner is very witty. Two or three re-reads of this book revealed hidden jokes, subtext, and meanings that I was clueless about the first time through. Even a short sentence might hide something that flies by at first glance. For example, take this sentence from a scene between Gen and the queen, in the queen's bedroom: ""I can't keep on apologizing,"" he said. ""Why not?"" she asked over his head. ""Well,"" he said pensively, ""I think you would be bored."" It was vain to hope he might cease to have things to apologize for. ""What happened?"" she asked. At first glance, the sentence doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Then you wrap your brain around it, and realize what she really means: It was unlikely that Eugenides was going to stop doing stupid things, which means that it's just as unlikely he'll stop having stupid things to apologize for. (But, of course, Attolia can always hope.) I'm really sad this book only has that many reviews. It sorely deserves more attention.",5,fantasy,"['love', 'book', 'usually', 'think', 'book', 'favorites', 'shelf', 'leave', 'speechless', 'exception', 'shot', 'installment', 'queen', 'thief', 'series', 'revolve', 'different', 'theme', 'thief', 'adventure', 'sequel', 'queen', 'attolia', 'politic', 'love', 'war', 'king', 'attolia', 'hide', 'depth', 'thing', 'appear', 'loyalty', 'trust', 'specifically', 'eugenides', 'thief', 'eddis', 'earn', 'loyalty', 'court', 'attolia', 'bumpy', 'ride', 'silly', 'prank', 'conspiracy', 'gossip', 'hatred', 'prejudice', 'turn', 'eugenides', 'dig', 'hole', 'deep', 'manipulate', 'way', 'gen', 'amazingly', 'complex', 'character', 'appear', 'outside', 'inept', 'foolish', 'weak', 'idiot', 'way', 'unfit', 'king', 'fall', 'asleep', 'court', 'meeting', 'handle', 'misbehave', 'attendant', 'refuse', 'punish', 'man', 'hit', 'jaw', 'rage', 'court', 'call', 'handed', 'goatfoot', 'abduct', 'queen', 'steal', 'throne', 'know', 'know', 'wrong', 'cunning', 'chessmaster', 'know', 'exactly', 'bow', 'careful', 'planning', 'negotiation', 'mercy', 'instead', 'queen', 'prefer', 'execution', 'course', 'time', 'eugenides', 'prove', 'king', 'warrior', 'narrate', 'revelation', 'narrative', 'novel', 'give', 'personal', 'subject', 'guardsman', 'name', 'costis', 'suspect', 'tool', 'let', 'reader', 'inside', 'eugenides', 'wife', 'attolias', 'personal', 'life', 'give', 'privacy', 'fine', 'love', 'romance', 'gen', 'love', 'hate', 'stay', 'love', 'torture', 'cut', 'hand', 'boy', 'bad', 'fall_love', 'cut', 'hand', 'complicated', 'relationship', 'know', 'know', 'dance', 'line', 'young_adult', 'fiction', 'child', 'fiction', 'sweet', 'kiss', 'hear', 'book', 'upcoming', 'fourth', 'title', 'conspiracy', 'kings', 'hope', 'interesting', 'complex', 'pair', 'megan', 'whalen', 'turner', 'witty', 'read', 'book', 'reveal', 'hide', 'joke', 'subtext', 'meaning', 'clueless', 'time', 'short', 'sentence', 'hide', 'fly', 'glance', 'example', 'sentence', 'scene', 'gen', 'queen', 'queen', 'bedroom', 'apologize', 'say', 'ask', 'head', 'say', 'pensively', 'think', 'bored', 'vain', 'hope', 'cease', 'thing', 'apologize', 'happen', 'ask', 'glance', 'sentence', 'lot', 'sense', 'wrap', 'brain', 'realize', 'mean', 'unlikely', 'eugenides', 'go', 'stop', 'stupid', 'thing', 'mean', 'unlikely', 'stop', 'have', 'stupid', 'thing', 'apologize', 'course', 'attolia', 'hope', 'sad', 'book', 'review', 'sorely', 'deserve', 'attention']"
158,"Such a great book. There is romance and fighting, scheming and parties-- I couldn't get enough. One thing I did enjoy was that Kestrel is a strong female lead, even though she is not a good fighter. Being a kickass fighter is not the only thing to make someone strong and Kestrel's talent, is strategy. Which is awesome. It means she intelligent. Although, there are times she is naive of certain things about Arin... I loved the characterization of everyone but, some sequences of events seems abrupt or just thrown out there. Namely  Cheat liking her out of the blue so he was killed, then the Emperor's decision to make her his son's wife... seemed a little weak but, I get it. Seriously loved this book but, I thought there was a little something missing which keeps it from the 5. I thought the story flow was a bit off. slow, good, then a sprint. I also wanted more information all the time but, that's just me trying to get pulled in more. And something else can't I can't name.. only a feel. Highly recommend it.

159,"Forget sexy, though he is -- I think Raffe is just the cutest, sweetest being ever! The way he's all macho and tough, but you can just tell he has this massive soft spot for Penryn. Warms mah heart <3 I also loved how subtle the romance is -- Penryn isn't one of those brainless girls who forget everything in their rush to be wiffff theyz vwuvverr -- so irritating when that happens! Instead she's focused till the very end on the main goal: getting Paige. The rest just kinda happens, very slowly and naturally. I really appreciate Paige, too. many, many books talk about how even though one character goes on a quest for a family member or something, that said family member is always returned unharmed, hunky-dory, and as fine and un-traumatized as the day they left. It takes enormous courage to write Paige as she became, but it pays off beautifully - as a reader, I wanted to cry and cheer and then cry some more by the end. The end was wonderful -- what happened to Raffe's wings in the end made my jaw drop, and the fact that he did what he did brought tears to my eyes, and the last few sentences left me with a sweet smile on my face and a burgeoning excitement to see what's next for this angel and his Daughter of Man.",4,fantasy,"['forget', 'sexy', 'think', 'raffe', 'cut', 'sweet', 'way', 'macho', 'tough', 'tell', 'massive', 'soft', 'spot', 'penryn', 'warm', 'mah', 'heart', 'love', 'subtle', 'romance', 'penryn', 'brainless', 'girl', 'forget', 'rush', 'wiffff', 'theyz', 'vwuvverr', 'irritating', 'happen', 'instead', 'focused', 'till_end', 'main', 'goal', 'get', 'paige', 'rest', 'kinda', 'happen', 'slowly', 'naturally', 'appreciate', 'paige', 'book', 'talk', 'character', 'go', 'quest', 'family_member', 'say', 'family_member', 'return', 'unharmed', 'hunky', 'dory', 'fine', 'un', 'traumatized', 'day', 'leave', 'take', 'enormous', 'courage', 'write', 'paige', 'pay', 'beautifully', 'reader', 'want', 'cry', 'cheer', 'cry', 'end', 'end', 'wonderful', 'happen', 'raffe', 'wing', 'end', 'jaw', 'drop', 'fact', 'bring', 'tear', 'eye', 'sentence', 'leave', 'sweet', 'smile', 'face', 'burgeon', 'excitement', 'angel', 'daughter', 'man']"
160,"I agree with what most reviewers seem to be saying. This was better than the second book, but not as good as the first one. I liked most of the story. I didn't quite love it, but I enjoyed the ride. The characters had a good part of their charm back and the girls together worked pretty well. And the quest to find and help David provided a good framework for the book. I also really like seeing the scenes from David's point of view. It gave us a good idea of what was going on inside his head while the Oracle was driving him mad. And then that ending was so... disappointing. I really really wanted it to end a certain way, and it almost did, but then it didn't and the ending was instead pretty lame, honestly. And kinda creepy, when you think about it. So Harper killed David, which would have been a brave and strong way to end the series. It would have been sad, but there's nothing wrong with sad endings to hard situations. I much prefer those to the predictable endings where everything is fixed, everyone is happy, and nothing's lost. So when David showed up again, my disappointment was real. It's not like I didn't like the guy, but it was a weak ending, with David magically being brought back to life with the Oracle powers gone. Granted, it was foreshadowed and it did cost David his memory. So it wasn't out of nowhere and it wasn't too perfect, but to me the foreshadowing only made it predictable, instead of more realistic, and as for David's memory loss... aren't the repercussions of that kind of disturbing? For one, David doesn't seem to think anything is weird, so how much is Blythe really adjusting his mind? Did she give him 17 years of fake memories? He won't remember Sailor, or anything that's ever happened to him, so to what extent is he really the same person? And what now? Harper and co will befriend him and she'll get together with him but none of them will every tell them anything about what's happened? Harper knows a lot of stuff about him, not to mention the fact that she killed him, but she's never going to tell him about any of it? I guess maybe at some point they could tell him everything, but it didn't seem that way at the end of the book and I have to say, that's seriously messed up. And what about everything else? Did Blythe change the memories of the entire school? Again, messed up. It would have just been so much better if he'd stayed dead. Edit: Forgot to mention I listened to the audiobook for this one, because I don't buy hardcovers, I didn't want to wait for the paperback, and I didn't think I'd pick it up on ebook anytime soon. It was the right good choice for me, as I really enjoyed the narration. The southern accents were strong and I think it really added to the charm of the characters, so I recommend it!",3,fantasy,"['agree', 'reviewer', 'say', 'well', 'second', 'book', 'good', 'like', 'story', 'love', 'enjoy', 'ride', 'character', 'good', 'charm', 'girl', 'work', 'pretty', 'quest', 'find', 'help', 'david', 'provide', 'good', 'framework', 'book', 'like', 'see', 'scene', 'david', 'point_view', 'give', 'good', 'idea', 'go', 'inside', 'head', 'oracle', 'drive', 'mad', 'ending', 'disappointing', 'want', 'end', 'certain', 'way', 'ending', 'instead', 'pretty', 'lame', 'honestly', 'kinda', 'creepy', 'think', 'harper', 'kill', 'david', 'brave', 'strong', 'way', 'end', 'series', 'sad', 'wrong', 'sad', 'ending', 'hard', 'situation', 'prefer', 'predictable', 'ending', 'fix', 'happy', 'lose', 'david', 'show', 'disappointment', 'real', 'like', 'like', 'guy', 'weak', 'ending', 'david', 'magically', 'bring', 'life', 'oracle', 'power', 'go', 'grant', 'foreshadow', 'cost', 'david', 'memory', 'perfect', 'foreshadowing', 'predictable', 'instead', 'realistic', 'david', 'memory', 'loss', 'repercussion', 'kind', 'disturbing', 'david', 'think', 'weird', 'blythe', 'adjust', 'mind', 'year', 'fake', 'memory', 'will', 'remember', 'sailor', 'happen', 'extent', 'person', 'harper', 'co', 'befriend', 'tell', 'happen', 'harper', 'know', 'lot', 'stuff', 'mention', 'fact', 'kill', 'go', 'tell', 'guess', 'maybe', 'point', 'tell', 'way', 'end', 'book', 'seriously', 'mess', 'blythe', 'change', 'memory', 'entire', 'school', 'mess', 'well', 'stay', 'dead', 'edit', 'forget', 'mention', 'listen_audiobook', 'buy', 'hardcover', 'want', 'wait', 'paperback', 'think', 'pick', 'ebook', 'anytime', 'soon', 'right', 'good', 'choice', 'enjoy', 'narration', 'southern', 'accent', 'strong', 'think', 'add', 'charm', 'character', 'recommend']"
161,"Sixteen years after Leviticus Blue undermined the city's banks with his Russian-commissioned Boneshaker machine, Seattle is a very different place. The boring caused a gas to be released from deep underground, corroding whatever it touched and raising the dead as ""rotters."" A wall has been built around the city to keep the gas in, but it's only a matter of time before it comes spilling out. In the meantime, Blue's son, Zeke, ventures under the wall, into the Blight, hoping to find the truth about his father. After an earthquake traps him inside the city, his mother comes in the hopes of rescuing him. With airships, fantastical machinery, and zombies, it's hard to see where Boneshaker could go wrong. Unfortunately, there were a few key issues that prevented me from really liking the book. The first was the over use of coincidence. I can ignore it if it's used only very occasionally, or if it gets the ball rolling, and it works in a series like The Wheel of Time where it's explained by the world-building (in that case, it's the pattern weaving itself toward certain outcomes). But in Boneshaker, major aspects of the plot were directed by coincidence - an earthquake that blocks an exit just when a character goes through a tunnel, an airship crashing into a tower just when a character happens to be inside it, another airship that just happens to be repaired and ready to take off when the characters need to escape, etc. Far too much of the plot relied on these big coincidences, and it stretched my ability to suspend disbelief. Overall, it gave the impression that Priest was writing on the fly, coming up with the plot as she went. Sadly, I found the characters suffered from the same problem; I found them very underdeveloped. They are always reacting, getting thrown about the city by circumstances as though they've paid for the tour. I was often confused by a decision, which seemed out of what I'd been able to construct of their character, until I realized that it was necessary to get them to the location of the next adventure, or to show us a new area of the city. Even the ending, when Briar and Zeke appear to decide to stay in the city where they've been miserable and have spent the last few days in a constant state of almost dying, seemed the author's romanticised vision of the setting rather than anything the characters themselves would have chosen. Many of the side characters seemed interesting at first, until they stuck around long enough for me to realize that Priest had chosen one interesting image for them, and that was it. They had cool armour, or an interesting look, or an implied backstory, but no depth. In fact, the only character that seemed to have any real personality was the setting. Which leads me to the book's real strength: Seattle. There were some anachronisms, but the alternate history provided some cover there. I still always enjoy it when books have a sense of place, and the landmark details certainly did that. Priest also clearly put a good deal of thought into how the city might look in the Blight. The ambiance, with the need to wear gas masks and the moaning of the rotters, was fairly well done, and Priest certainly did a reasonably good job of building tension, except that I just didn't care what happened to any of the characters. As long as I could tour the setting along with someone, I found that I really didn't care much if it was Briar/Zeke, or if they were switched out midstream for some other ""guide."" The mechanics of writing were mostly solid, but there were some very odd word choices that threw me. One that stood out in particular was the use of the word ""for"" instead of something more conventional, like ""because."" It's oddly archaic, and stands out from the text around it. I noticed the same thing in Huntress by Malinda Lo, and it bugged me there, too. My final gripe is about the ending. The plot structure is what could be described as an ""onion"" plot, in which the real goal is the discovery of a piece of information - in this case, what happened with the Boneshaker machine. The question is raised at the very beginning, with a reporter approaching Briar for information, and it is finally answered at the very end. Unfortunately, the answer that had all the characters guessing, and at least one character risking his life and the lives of others to uncover, was almost immediately obvious. I read the whole book knowing the ending's big reveal, and my disappointment was dampened only by the fact that Priest seemed to care as little about it as I did. Sadly, it came with a missed opportunity, as I think that much more could have been made of the connection between Angeline's daughter and Briar, if only the characters had had a little more depth to them. I found this to be a fun fluff book, and the setting is certainly interesting enough to make it worth reading. It could have been a lot better, though, and it's a shame that the characters and plot weren't able to better complement the location.",4,fantasy,"['sixteen', 'year', 'leviticus', 'blue', 'undermine', 'city', 'bank', 'russian', 'commission', 'boneshaker', 'machine', 'seattle', 'different', 'place', 'boring', 'cause', 'gas', 'release', 'deep', 'underground', 'corrode', 'touch', 'raise', 'dead', 'rotter', 'wall', 'build', 'city', 'gas', 'matter', 'time', 'comes', 'spill', 'meantime', 'blue', 'son', 'zeke', 'venture', 'wall', 'blight', 'hope', 'find', 'truth', 'father', 'earthquake', 'trap', 'inside', 'city', 'mother', 'come', 'hope', 'rescue', 'airship', 'fantastical', 'machinery', 'zombie', 'hard', 'boneshaker', 'wrong', 'unfortunately', 'key', 'issue', 'prevent', 'like', 'book', 'use', 'coincidence', 'ignore', 'occasionally', 'get', 'ball', 'roll', 'work', 'series', 'like', 'wheel', 'time', 'explain', 'world_building', 'case', 'pattern', 'weave', 'certain', 'outcome', 'boneshaker', 'major', 'aspect', 'plot', 'direct', 'coincidence', 'earthquake', 'block', 'exit', 'character', 'go', 'tunnel', 'airship', 'crash', 'tower', 'character', 'happen', 'inside', 'airship', 'happen', 'repair', 'ready', 'character', 'need', 'escape', 'etc', 'far', 'plot', 'rely', 'big', 'coincidence', 'stretch', 'ability', 'suspend', 'disbelief', 'overall', 'give', 'impression', 'priest', 'write', 'fly', 'come', 'plot', 'go', 'sadly', 'find', 'character', 'suffer', 'problem', 'find', 'underdeveloped', 'react', 'getting', 'throw', 'city', 'circumstance', 'pay', 'tour', 'confuse', 'decision', 'able', 'construct', 'character', 'realize', 'necessary', 'location', 'adventure', 'new', 'area', 'city', 'ending', 'briar', 'zeke', 'appear', 'decide', 'stay', 'city', 'miserable', 'spend', 'day', 'constant', 'state', 'die', 'author', 'romanticised', 'vision', 'setting', 'character', 'choose', 'character', 'interesting', 'stick', 'long', 'realize', 'priest', 'choose', 'interesting', 'image', 'cool', 'armour', 'interesting', 'look', 'implied', 'backstory', 'depth', 'fact', 'character', 'real', 'personality', 'setting', 'lead', 'book', 'real', 'strength', 'seattle', 'anachronism', 'alternate', 'history', 'provide', 'cover', 'enjoy', 'book', 'sense', 'place', 'landmark', 'detail', 'certainly', 'priest', 'clearly', 'good', 'deal', 'thought', 'city', 'look', 'blight', 'ambiance', 'need', 'wear', 'gas', 'mask', 'moaning', 'rotter', 'fairly', 'priest', 'certainly', 'reasonably', 'good_job', 'build', 'tension', 'care', 'happen', 'character', 'long', 'tour', 'setting', 'find', 'care', 'briar', 'zeke', 'switch', 'midstream', 'guide', 'mechanic', 'writing', 'solid', 'odd', 'word', 'choice', 'throw', 'stand', 'particular', 'use', 'word', 'instead', 'conventional', 'like', 'oddly', 'archaic', 'stand', 'text', 'notice', 'thing', 'huntress', 'malinda', 'lo', 'bug', 'final', 'gripe', 'ending', 'plot', 'structure', 'describe', 'onion', 'plot', 'real', 'goal', 'discovery', 'piece', 'information', 'case', 'happen', 'boneshaker', 'machine', 'question', 'raise', 'beginning', 'reporter', 'approach', 'briar', 'information', 'finally', 'answer', 'end', 'unfortunately', 'answer', 'character', 'guess', 'character', 'risk', 'life', 'life', 'uncover', 'immediately', 'obvious', 'read', 'book', 'know', 'ending', 'big_reveal', 'disappointment', 'dampen', 'fact', 'priest', 'care', 'little', 'sadly', 'come', 'miss', 'opportunity', 'think', 'connection', 'angeline', 'daughter', 'briar', 'character', 'little', 'depth', 'find', 'fun', 'fluff', 'book', 'setting', 'certainly', 'interesting', 'worth', 'reading', 'lot', 'well', 'shame', 'character', 'plot', 'able', 'well', 'complement', 'location']"
162,"Don't know why I didn't like this book as much as the last one. It moves along at the same pace, although maybe the character development isn't as evident. Again, there's the feeling the pieces are getting moved around the board so as to set up the endgame. If I was to pick a favourite part of this book, I'd say that Arya's story arc is the most satisfying. I might have said Jon's if it wasn't for the turn of events towards the end of the book.

163,"This was one of the rare times I binged a book/audiobook, and one of the few audiobook and physical book combo I have purchased and owned myself. I first became aware of this book through many of my favorite book blogs and media sites. I've always been interested in space and the frontiers of our known universe. Immediately this book caught my attention, having recently been infatuated with Mars. One day, I was in the store, in the book section obviously, when I saw the movie cover version of the book. Quickly I grabbed it though I had it in my hands for only a few seconds when I saw the audiobook mP3 CD. Now usually audiobooks cost a fortune compared to the physical book. However this was the first time I'd seen an audio mP3 CD. The crazy thing was this version only cost $13, only a few dollars more than the physical copy I held in my hands. I thought what the hell, and bought the audiobook instead. Knowing the movie was about to be released I wanted to read the book before I went and saw it. Then in turn I wanted to see the movie before I wrote this review, so as to have an enhanced view. With all that being said, here we go! ""The Martian"" was an amazing experience of actual not-far-off scientific fiction. It is very intelligently and comically written. Astronaut Mark Watney, is a member of the Ares III Mars crew, who has been stranded on the red planet after a Martian storm forces the rest of his crew to evacuate. The crew only leaves him behind after believing him dead. Watney survives the storm by sheer dumb luck, after being hit by debris. Unfortunately that debris was a central part of the Ares III, com systems. So now he is stuck without a way to communicate with earth or his crew, and a ride home. The next group to arrive, the Ares IV crew, won't arrive for another 4 years. The work itself is written through a series of log entries on Watney's end through the sols (Martian day) on Mars. additionally there are third person POVs from those back on earth in NASA, and later through technical parlance between the two. It's almost like a found footage film in literary form. Essentially a book of found documents. This gives the book a more realistic feel. There is a lot of mathematical and scientific jargon that can easily confused the reader if they don't follow along closely. However Weir's strong character building and their humorous personalities provide the glue that holds the novel together. More often than not the film adaptation of a book rarely lives up to the plot and subject matter of the source material. There are exceptions, ""Harry Potter"", ""The Fault in Our Stars"", ""Lord of the Rings"", and ""The Perks of Being a Wallflower"", to name a select few. ""The Martian"" is one of those exemptions. Especially finishing the book and seeing the film in such a close frame of time, I was thoroughly satisfied and entertained by the movie adaptation. Being a literary purist to some extent, I felt the film was extremely true to its source material. Even down to the ancillary scenes and dialogue. As opposed to other books to film, like ""The Giver"", ""Ender's Game"", ""The Maze Runner"", and one of my all time favorite books, ""The Hobbit"", the filmmakers didn't make any extreme creative license exchanges. All the better for this film. It's understood you can't fit everything in a novel in a 2 hour 20 minute film, but that's why I always encourage reading the book to get the inside thoughts and explanations you wouldn't get in a film. The minor changes in the film are mostly welcome. For instance Watney giving himself staples instead of stitches at the beginning. Him actually using the Iron Man depressurization maneuver mentioned in the book, and expanding upon the ending of the book to give the viewer a look at Watney's life after Mars, and the future of Mars exploration. I love this extension; after listening to the somewhat abrupt but still satisfying end of the book which leaves off with the Hermes rescue in Mars orbit. The only thing I really wanted more of was more snark from NASA's press secretary Annie Montrose, played by Kristen Wiig. I especially enjoyed the scene in the film where the NASA administrators are talking about Project Elrond, with Sean Bean's character, Mitch Henderson, present. I do believe director Ridley Scott snuck an LOTR Easter egg joke into the film. It reminds me of the scene in ""Men Who Stare at Goats"" where Ewan McGregor's character asks what a Jedi is. All this being said the Martian film is not even on par with ""Interstellar"" though, it's two steps, no two strokes, better, and on a more realistic scale! I loved both the film AND the book, they can stand alone, but they are oh so great together! I now own a physical copy of the book, along with the audio book, as well as the DVD, and my initial ticket stub from my local theater!

164,"3.5 stars This book was weird. It so boring at times yet somewhat enjoyable. The only reason I was able to enjoy this was because of that romance. Seriously, what the fuck happened, I'm still screaming. Here are some reasons why I liked this book: *We don't have a skinny MC. I love how Elisa wasn't a skinny heroine and what she looks like shouldn't matter. She was smart, brave, thought and extremely fucking annoying at times and I loved it. *I loved how Humberto treated her. He fell in love with her because of her personality and he didn't care that she was fat, which seriously shouldn't matter. *The romance. SERIOUS SPOILER. DO NOT OPEN IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK. this is the first book where both of the fucking love interests die. hats off to you Rae Carson. well done *This book has God in it. Which was very weird at first, but then I got used to it and was pretty normal about it. It's weird seeing God in a YA Fantasy book. I'm religious and it was very weird at first because it's not something we read about everyday. But I'm glad to see a book where God plays an impact. It isn't even preachy so that's great. What I didn't like: *The fucking plot. The plot takes a completely new turn in the second half of this book, like what the fuck is even going on. Slow down, I'm dumb, let me process all this, thanks. *This was very boring and slow at times??? Like I was ready to DNF this around 200 pages BUT THEN HUMBERTO CAME IN AND SAVED THE DAY. This was a great read and I'd like to read the sequel.",3,fantasy,"['star', 'book', 'weird', 'boring', 'time', 'somewhat', 'enjoyable', 'reason', 'able', 'enjoy', 'romance', 'seriously', 'fuck', 'happen', 'scream', 'reason', 'like', 'book', 'skinny', 'mc', 'love', 'elisa', 'skinny', 'heroine', 'look', 'like', 'matter', 'smart', 'brave', 'think', 'extremely', 'fucking', 'annoying', 'time', 'love', 'love', 'humberto', 'treat', 'fall_love', 'personality', 'care', 'fat', 'seriously', 'matter', 'romance', 'spoiler', 'open', 'read', 'book', 'book', 'fucking', 'love_interest', 'die', 'hat', 'rae', 'carson', 'book', 'god', 'weird', 'get', 'pretty', 'normal', 'weird', 'see', 'god', 'ya', 'fantasy', 'book', 'religious', 'weird', 'read', 'everyday', 'glad', 'book', 'god', 'play', 'impact', 'preachy', 'great', 'like', 'fucking', 'plot', 'plot', 'take', 'completely', 'new', 'turn', 'second_half', 'book', 'like', 'fuck', 'go', 'slow', 'dumb', 'let', 'process', 'thank', 'boring', 'slow', 'time', 'like', 'ready', 'dnf', 'page', 'humberto', 'come', 'save', 'day', 'great', 'read', 'like', 'read', 'sequel']"
165,"Words cannot describe how happy I am to say that the old Anita is back! Finally, we have a book worth reading. Affliction is a long book- over 500 pages, in fact. And all of them are filled with flesh-eating zombie, rotting vampire mayhem. When I first realized this was another book away from home, I figured it would be more of the same where I wouldn't get to see any of my favorite characters. I am pleasantly surprised to be reporting that this initial assumption was incorrect. Spoilers for which characters come out to play:  While I still miss Jason, I did get to see Jean-Claude. Along with Nathaniel and Micah, we get to see Anita's main sweeties. Not only that, but there was Edward! I have always loved Edward. It was a relief to not have to read more bullshit about the golden tigers or read chapter after chapter of Anita's relationship angst. There was sex, but not a lot of it. Instead of plot interspersed with sex scenes, the scenes with Anita's lovers flowed with the plot at reasonable times she needed to feed. Basically, I was thrilled to have our favorite kick-ass necromancer at the helm of the story, instead of the weird overly-emotional Anita of Kiss the Dead. (which I really didn't like).

167,"AAAAMAZING! I am in love with this book. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The WHOLE time! And I actually cried a little when Julian told his story to Grace ... How can someone not love him at all? No family, no real friends ... even the one he trusted much Iason, say betrayed him. I felt so bad about Julian when I read about his children and the fact that in people's eyes he was just a mighty good general, but actually that was all he was! No one loved him. Intil Grace! And all that curse thing ... to be alone in that book for such a looooooong time? That should be really driving someone insane, but Julian was quite normal when he got out .. and oooo baby, he was hot! Really hot! I mean every woman would react the way Grace did when she saw him. An ancient Greek love slave coming out of a book, standing completely naked in front of you and with a glorious body ... only for your pleasure! I would freak out too! So the book was amazing, with a great ending that made me scream out of horror when I thought that scum Priapus killed Julian  and then out of joy when Julian decided to stay with Grace and then the birth of their kids ... and before that Aphrodite's at last shown love for her son!

169,"I really enjoyed this, on multiple levels. It is one of the best romances I read in 2016. The writing is wonderful. The story is complex and nuanced. The way these characters navigate power, privilege and consent in their BDSM is lovely. Their relationship is so damn swoony, and I was rooting for them almost all the way (I had a couple of reservations, which I go into in the next paragraphs). This is a cross-class relationship that is all about navigating intense class and political divides, and I deeply enjoyed it's engagement with these things as real, complex, thorny, tangled, and perhaps impossible things to navigate. The way they get resolved broke my heart a bit, I need to say, which made it somewhat difficult for me to enjoy the swooniness of the happy ending. Another thing that made it difficult for me to fully commit to the ending: Late in the story, one of the love interests both thinks and says some transphobic things. He is corrected by the other love interest on the part of it that he verbalizes. Then the moment passes by, as if his transphobia is expected and normal and really nobody should have issue with the fact that not only did he say something transphobic but he also considered using threats to out a working class criminalized sex worker's transness as a lever to manipulate that person to get something he needed. Gotta say, I was less enamored of him as a love interest after that, especially since he supposedly was all about being principled. I guess I was supposed to be ok with it because he decides not to overtly say it to the trans person and saves his transphobic remarks for his lover? Or is it somehow supposed to be romantic, because the thing he needed had to do with his lover? (Ugh to that. Not my kind of romance.) Trigger Warnings:  A good portion of the plot is driven by both anti-kink hatred and self loathing on the part of one of the characters. This is textually challenged, and resolved in a way that worked for me as someone who has dealt with a lot of this in my own life. As I mentioned above, there is some transphobia, some of which is challenged. The transphobia felt gratuitous, though the correction was kind of nice to read. Also, these are deeply closeted queer characters who are constantly aware of and frequently discuss how their queerness is criminalized, and work hard to pass as straight. This book has a central character who is basically a police officer falling for a central character who is a criminalized revolutionary, and so it is chock full of the things you might expect, violence, criminalization, execution, police brutality, the enactment of fascist policing laws. It goes into particular detail about the criminalization of poverty and the vulnerability of homeless and poor people in the face of both state power and the individual power of aristocrats.",4,history,"['enjoy', 'multiple', 'level', 'good', 'romance', 'read', 'writing', 'wonderful', 'story', 'complex', 'nuanced', 'way', 'character', 'navigate', 'power', 'privilege', 'consent', 'bdsm', 'lovely', 'relationship', 'damn', 'swoony', 'root', 'way', 'couple', 'reservation', 'paragraph', 'cross', 'class', 'relationship', 'navigate', 'intense', 'class', 'political', 'divide', 'deeply', 'enjoy', 'engagement', 'thing', 'real', 'complex', 'thorny', 'tangled', 'impossible', 'thing', 'navigate', 'way', 'resolve', 'break_heart', 'bit', 'need', 'somewhat', 'difficult', 'enjoy', 'swooniness', 'happy_ending', 'thing', 'difficult', 'fully', 'commit', 'ending', 'late', 'story', 'love_interest', 'think', 'say', 'transphobic', 'thing', 'correct', 'love_interest', 'verbalize', 'moment', 'pass', 'transphobia', 'expected', 'normal', 'issue', 'fact', 'transphobic', 'consider', 'threat', 'work', 'class', 'criminalize', 'sex', 'worker', 'transness', 'lever', 'manipulate', 'person', 'need', 'got_to', 'enamored', 'love_interest', 'especially', 'supposedly', 'principled', 'guess', 'suppose', 'ok', 'decide', 'overtly', 'trans', 'person', 'save', 'transphobic', 'remark', 'lover', 'suppose', 'romantic', 'thing', 'need', 'lover', 'ugh', 'kind', 'romance', 'trigger_warning', 'good', 'portion', 'plot', 'drive', 'anti', 'kink', 'hatred', 'self', 'loathing', 'character', 'textually', 'challenge', 'resolve', 'way', 'work', 'deal', 'lot', 'life', 'mention', 'transphobia', 'challenge', 'transphobia', 'feel', 'gratuitous', 'correction', 'kind', 'nice', 'read', 'deeply', 'closeted', 'queer', 'character', 'constantly', 'aware', 'frequently', 'discuss', 'queerness', 'criminalize', 'work', 'hard', 'pass', 'straight', 'book', 'central', 'character', 'basically', 'police_officer', 'fall', 'central', 'character', 'criminalize', 'revolutionary', 'chock', 'thing', 'expect', 'violence', 'criminalization', 'execution', 'police', 'brutality', 'enactment', 'fascist', 'policing', 'law', 'go', 'particular', 'detail', 'criminalization', 'poverty', 'vulnerability', 'homeless', 'poor', 'people', 'face', 'state', 'power', 'individual', 'power', 'aristocrat']"
170,"5+ stars - Historical/Regency Romance WOW! I loved this, especially devilishly charismatic rake, the Marquis of St. Aubyn. Saint is a deliciously debauched scoundrel who glories in his depraved ways and pursuits, but he meets his match in caring, headstrong Evelyn. She's determined to save the Heart of Hope Orphanage and teach Saint a lesson in compassion in the process; even if it means engaging him in a provocative battle of wills and indulging in his dangerous game of seduction. But who will be the victor of their passionate ""lessons in love""? St. Aubyn reminded me a lot of Sebastian, Lord St. Vincent from Devil in Winter by Lisa Kleypas (one of the sexiest, yummiest romantic heroes, ever! ), and both heroines have the same informal name, Evie, strong countenances, and kindhearted natures. Hmmm...interesting...But the stories are decidedly different and each have their own charms. If you enjoy romances with unrepentant rake heroes who just love to be bad and spirited heroines who give as good as they get, then don't miss this wonderful, engaging read. It's a keeper! Big 5 stars! My ode to Saint: S-infully scrumptious, seductive scoundrel A-morous, amusing, and amoral rake I-rresistibly charming N-efariously naughty T-enaciously wicked I love Evie's musing of Saint's sex appeal. His smooth panther's stalk was magnetic even when he wasn't hunting. With an entire room full of willing game, then, why was he after her? This is my favorite sigh-worthy moment. ""I told you that I didn't have a heart,"" he continued as he gazed up at her, his voice shaking just a little. ""I do have one. I just didn't know it until I met you. You are my light. My soul craves you, and I love you with every ounce of the heart you've awakened in me. I...I could live without you, but I wouldn't want to."" This is my favorite steamy moment.

171,"Added 1/9/15. (First published in 2014.) (WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZE) (The GR Constant Reader group has chosen this book as their reading selection beginning June 15, 2015. I read this book in Feb. You can read a sample of this book (first 21 chapters) at: https://play.google.com/books/reader?... At Amazon it says: ""Publication Date: May 6, 2014 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD FINALIST ""From the highly acclaimed, multiple award-winning Anthony Doerr, the beautiful, stunningly ambitious instant New York Times bestseller about a blind French girl and a German boy whose paths collide in occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of World War II."" ""An Amazon Best Book of the Month, May 2014"" ABOVE IS FROM: http://www.amazon.com/All-Light-We-Ca... Below is a summary from my public library catalog. (It may be a spoiler for some people, although it clarifies things for me instead. Nevertheless, I will post it as a spoiler): Summary: ""From the highly acclaimed, multiple award-winning Anthony Doerr, a stunningly ambitious and beautiful novel about a blind French girl and a German boy whose paths collide in occupied France as both try to survive the devastation of World War II. Marie Laure lives with her father in Paris within walking distance of the Museum of Natural History where he works as the master of the locks (there are thousands of locks in the museum). When she is six, she goes blind, and her father builds her a model of their neighborhood, every house, every manhole, so she can memorize it with her fingers and navigate the real streets with her feet and cane. When the Germans occupy Paris, father and daughter flee to Saint-Malo on the Brittany coast, where Marie-Laure's agoraphobic great uncle lives in a tall, narrow house by the sea wall. In another world in Germany, an orphan boy, Werner, grows up with his younger sister, Jutta, both enchanted by a crude radio Werner finds. He becomes a master at building and fixing radios, a talent that wins him a place at an elite and brutal military academy and, ultimately, makes him a highly specialized tracker of the Resistance. Werner travels through the heart of Hitler Youth to the far-flung outskirts of Russia, and finally into Saint-Malo, where his path converges with Marie-Laure. Doerr's gorgeous combination of soaring imagination with observation is electric. Deftly interweaving the lives of Marie-Laure and Werner, Doerr illuminates the ways, against all odds, people try to be good to one another. Ten years in the writing, All the Light We Cannot See is his most ambitious and dazzling work""  -- Provided by publisher. ABOUT THE TITLE (explained by the author): ""It's a reference first and foremost to all the light we literally cannot see: that is, the wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum that are beyond the ability of human eyes to detect (radio waves, of course, being the most relevant). It's also a metaphorical suggestion that there are countless invisible stories still buried within World War II -- that stories of ordinary children, for example, are a kind of light we do not typically see. Ultimately, the title is intended as a suggestion that we spend too much time focused on only a small slice of the spectrum of possibility."" - Anthony Doerr explains in _All the Light We Cannot See_ - FAQ (taken from his website at: http://www.anthonydoerr.com/press/441/) PS-I posted the following at my GR group: As for, All the Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr, I read the sample at: https://play.google.com/books/reader?... The sample provided 21 chapters of the book. The book seems ""fragmented"" to me. One chapter is about one character and place. The next chapter skips to an entirely different character and place. Then it goes back to the other place and character. I know that they come together toward the end, but I'm not a fan of that sort of fragmentation. Irving Wallace used to write that way and I enjoyed his stories, e.g. The Prize. Perhaps my poor old memory prevents me from enjoying fragmentation these days. I lose track of the thread while hopping around. Nevertheless I think the story is worth taking a further look at. The sample didn't disturb me but I suppose I haven't gotten to the real grim parts which a friend warned me about. PPS-I wrote the following at my GR group: 2/23/15 - ""I found the book (""All the Light..."") to be too ""wordy"" at times. I know Doerr is praised for his beautiful writing but at times the descriptions got to be just too much! He sets a haunting atmosphere but the over-abundance of words got in my way. Otherwise, it's a compelling plot. All that skipping around (time-shifts/place shifts) back and forth bothered me at times. And in the end there were unanswered questions in my mind. The ending didn't completely satisfy me. [Edit: The ending was a let-down because the boy and girl hardly interacted with one another. I had expected more interaction between them. Instead it's a story of their parallel lives and they meet only once when he saves her life. ] Also, the horrors of war were hard to take."" PPPS-A Goodreads member made a good point when she wrote the following in her review: ""I was expecting both the main characters to have more interaction with each other than there was which added to my disappointment."" I felt the same. Her review is at: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... PPPPS-There's an excellent blog about ""the dramatic irony"" in _All the Light We Cannot See_. The blog is at: http://weedlit.blogspot.com/2014/10/d... Definition of Dramatic Irony: ---""Dramatic irony occurs when the audience knows something the characters do not."" ---""irony that is inherent in speeches or a situation of a drama and is understood by the audience but not grasped by the characters in the play.""

172,"I was definitely disappointed with this one. The series had been pretty good up until Lion Heart. Here are my gripes, in no particular order. Scarlet/Marian. Oh girl, you just need to let it go. Yes, she has some serious issues still. She loves Rob, but she keeps pulling away from him because she doesn't want to lose him. Wait, what? Just be with him already! Stop beating around the bush. Then we have dear Rob. His PTSD nightmare episodes from the last book are all but forgotten, except for one conversation. I feel like that was swept under the rug but should have had more explanation between the two. But that's not the worst part of it. When Marian is gifted his land/title from the Queen in order to keep them from Prince John, Robin freaks out and gets really angry. He basically whines like a child and says that they were supposed to be his. Yeah, no shit, but did he ever stop to think that there was a reason the Queen did it? Nope, he just broods like a baby. He did have some good moments, but I think he was just a little ridiculous there. Prince John. In Lady Thief, he was extremely evil. But in Lion Heart, he is almost comical. He's still a ruthless killer, but his dialogue was so bad that he reminded me of the Prince John from the Disney movie. The last scene in the end made me laugh where he was yelling at his mother because she was siding with Marian/Scarlet. Oh, that ending. The whole book is built around this plot that King Richard has been captured and unless they raise the ransom to free him, he will be killed. Well, they defeated Prince John at the end but where the hell was Richard?! It made no sense to talk about him for 90% of the book only for him not to make an appearance or for the author to say what happened to him after they defeated Prince John. Holy cliffhanger? If this was the final installment, then why the loose ends? It disappointed me. I wanted Marian to meet her father. That was the whole point of the reveal in the previous book! Lion Heart was not all bad, it just didn't make sense. Sure, Marian and Rob got their happy ending, but so much was left out. I really enjoyed the character David, and then he was killed. That made me really upset. . Speaking of David, Gaughen wrote a scene where he and Allan were fighting but neither of them told Marian why. That was also never resolved. What happened?! Why do the readers not get to know? I will say that Winchester was my favorite. But why the hell did we barely get an explanation about his ending? They just took off and that was it? Um, thanks? Overall I did enjoy this series, but sometimes I wish I had never picked it up because this book was filled with too many plot holes and loose ends.

173,"I've read Jane Eyre quite a few times. I even taught it the one semester that I actually got to teach Brit Lit. Obviously, I like Jane Eyre and I enjoy retellings, so Jane Eyre set in 1950s/60s Scotland sounded pretty darn awesome. For the most part, I was not disappointed. I think Livesey did a great job of capturing the essence of Jane, through the character of Gemma who is lucky enough to live in a time when girls are beginning to have more options in life. The overall plot of the book is very similar to the original: after the death of our heroine's beloved uncle, she is treated terribly by his widow and their children, eventually sent away to school, until as a young woman, she find employment caring for the ward of a mysterious man. After nearly marrying her employer, she discovers a secret from his past, runs away and is taken in by caring strangers, almost marrying a passionless man, before returning to forgive the former employer with whom she will now find happiness. Livesey changes enough of the details to keep it fresh and interesting. I did find some of the plot changes a little underwhelming, but I appreciated her efforts. Some complaints from my fellow book group members (which I understand, even if I don't completely agree): The setting didn't feel consistent -- some parts felt like the 50s, but others more like the 70s or later -- particularly some of the overtly sexual behavior of female characters. A lot of what they referred to would have taken place in the mid to late 60s, so perhaps it was a bit ahead of it's time, but I don't think it was too far out of line. Some plot elements seemed thrown in the follow the original, but didn't really go anywhere -- i.e. the mysterious man who tries to pick up Jane in his car at the beginning. The ending was anticlamactic. I have to agree with this a bit. I was hoping she'd find something more dramatic in Iceland. Also, the fact that Sinclair chased after her, rather than her returning to him, changed the tone of the ending. But Gemma is more independent than Jane, partially (as I said before) because she has that luxury in the 1960s. I was really, really glad that Sinclair didn't go blind or become otherwise helpless. I always really hated that part of Jane Eyre.

174,"It was really interesting, and I really liked parts of it, but... it felt like it didn't really go anywhere. All this character development, and this mystery surrounding how the main character was having memories of her ancestors... and not much to show for it. There were two story lines: the main character, who is an author, and the story she is writing based on these serendipitous ""memories"" she's having. The stories just POUR of out her, and she does all this research, and in the end all there is is that she might be related distantly to her new boyfriend ? The parts of the stories surrounding the romances were great. I wanted more of her and Graham (I can't even remember her name. Carrie?). Angus the dog was pretty great. I honestly didn't care much for the story she was writing especially when the girl's husband died, but JUST KIDDING NO HE DIDN'T . I don't know. I didn't hate it as much as it probably seems.

175,"An engaging piece of historical fiction, Theodora: Actress, Empress, Whore took about 50 pages to get going. But once I crested that hill, I kept coming back for more. Theodora's mother never wanted her to enter the entertainment world, but after her father was brutally murdered, there was little choice if the family was to survive. And like her mother Hypatia, Theodora is nothing if not a survivor. Her talent for dance is only average, but her penchant for comedy launches Theodora into a spotlight career  that takes her from brother back rooms to faraway lands, on a religious pilgrimage, and home again to become the Empress of the entire Byzantine Empire. Duffy's fictional tale, which undoubtedly takes many liberties with the deeper aspects of Theodora's life, touches on many aspects of the sixth century, from politics to religion (which were deeply intertwined), and the acceptable roles of women. Though Theodora's exploits fascinated me (I loved the bit where she takes up spinning - I myself have started recently to spin! ), I was particularly touched by Duffy's commentary on the nature of relationships, from family and friends to God and spouse. These are skillfully woven and absolutely believable - not least because they touch a chord of recognition in me at some of my own experiences. At 300+ pages, Theodora is definitely worth every minute.

There is a LOT of mountain-climbing technical detail which seems to get out of hand at times, but mostly I found it fascinating. I would NEVER be crazy enough to attempt such feats of dangerous adventures. I came to really care about the characters and things did get very suspenseful in places.

177,"Kiera and Gage are once again involved in solving another mystery, but this one is far more personal to Kiera, giving us a great chance to learn more about her beyond her past with her brute of an anatomist husband. It says a lot for how sympathetic an heroine Kiera is that the enormous pain she experienced due to the events in The Mortal Arts soured my mood as much as hers. Although I liked her healthy, loving relationships with her sister and brother-in-law, it was even better seeing her stand on her own feet as an individual again - having her own social life and making decisions without the protective hovering of her family. The mystery in this book, while actually more compelling than the first because the broken, erratic and mysterious individual at its center had such a deep bond with Kiera, had less logical progression. Part of this was because of Kiera's very attachment to Will Dalmay - she admitted herself later on that she could not really be impartial in the investigation. His deteriorated mental condition also made him as much of a victim as a suspect, and thus Kiera spent a large part of the story tip-toeing around Will the way one would a frightened animal, rather than actually... investigating. But even less convincing was the sudden appearance of an almost comic book-style evil doctor villain, one who has been conducting horrendous experiments in an asylum of darkness and has set his sights on a new victim . That just isn't a fair murder mystery, is it? It's all so unsatisfyingly pat, though it made for excellent suspense-building. On the other hand, I was glad to have my concerns regarding whether Kiera and Gage's tumultuous romance would be dragged on by misunderstandings and feelings left unsaid proven false. If anything, their fiery arguments made Gage feel far more real to me as a character than he did in the first book, where he was almost always the master of himself. Thanks to Kiera, he's humbler, more open about his own personal demons and increasingly gentle.

And no, I don't mean that this is a case of plagiarism, but rather, that Eleanor Brown (fabulous author of The Weird Sisters, one of my favorite novels EVER) has crafted a story that is both generic and prodictable, and peopled it with characters that are underdeveloped and uninteresting. True, it showcases her typical panache for language and scope, but I was so underwhelmed. Margie was so annoying, even her rebellion fell flat. I didn't buy Madeleine as an organic character either.

179,"Thank you, for keeping yourself alive soldier. This book tore me apart and fed me to sharks for about 100 times. I mean I knew that I was going to expect a lot of  heavy  information because of how The Bronze Horseman ended., but god, it was all too much in one page. This is the most beautiful piece of literature that I have read. Hands freaking down! Okay, so it literally picked up from the last page of The Bronze Horseman, we have Alexander sentenced to prison and that is also why he sent Tatiana away with Dr. Seyers to escape to America. But Tatiana obviously did not know that. What got me super interested in this book was the fact that it talked about Alexander's past. I liked how I got to see Alexander pre-soviet union, when he was still in Barrington. I liked how I got to read about his own thoughts moving away from America. His own struggles with his family, how he  did not like  moving to the Soviet Union at all. I don't want to forget this boy, he thought, in case I ever need to come back to him. From that line alone, I knew that there was something deeper to his character, he's not just your tough-military guy, I was going to see the real Alexander Barrington. So the time interval of the book was literally years. And that kind of intimidated me somehow because they weren't together for 3 mother-freaking years. You guys, a lot can happen in a week okay? Let alone 3 damn years. The story took me to Tatiana in America and Alexander's prison-almost execution-military mission-prison again kind of life. If I were to be honest, I got really scared because people in the States were pushing Tatiana to forget about Alexander and a part of me wondered if she ever would. By the way, their son is so freaking cute I'm crying so hard. (MILITARY ROMANCE YOU GUYS) And I really didn't want that to happen cause at the same time, I was reading about how Alexander was trying his best to find his way back to her. /CUE TEARS/ But then it was also hard because Alexander kept wishing Tatiana  did  forget about him, that she moved on. So I was literally back and forth with these two that I myself just wanted to scream because hope was slowly dying for the both of them. AND ME AS WELL. Thanks, Paullina. Holy fuck when I was at the part Alexander found out that Pasha was freaking alive. I lost it. PLOT FREAKING TWIST. I never expected it because duh, all of Tatiana's family died back in Leningrad. I immediately thought of so many possibilities like a Tatiana and Pasha reunion. Pasha being alive sparked my hope up again because it would meant that this time, Alexander really will find his way back to her and bring her Pasha. But then... he fucking died. Like I was saying, the time interval was through years, so the next page can have a complete different story. When Pasha died, I was back to square 1 because Alexander surrendered himself and that freaking killed me. I already mentioned it before in my review of The Bronze Horseman and I'll mention it again... Tatiana is the most strongest female character out there. I don't care if people call her selfish or some shit. What she's been through, oh my god, this woman is a saint. From leaving Helsinki all the way to trying to survive in America with Anthony, the loneliness of bringing up your husband's kid  without  him. Tatiana's unanswered questions for 3 years. Tatiana going all the way to Europe just to rescue Alexander. My god. I applaud her so much. AND THAT IS WHAT YOU CALL LOVE. OK. I'm trying to figure out if I should be happy or anxious with the ending. They finally made it to the American embassy and it's kind of going okay. Alexander even said ""We are going home"" but before that he said he only wanted to say something comforting to Tatiana. SO WHAT THE FUCK DOES THAT MEAN. OMG. PLS. I can't.

Instead of fearing for Simon's safety or bucking up and forcing him to confront his demons (and helping him do so), she runs off to her father right when Simon needs her most. The fact that she'd made no great effort to really get to know Simon or get to the bottom of his darkness before or immediately after she married him casts her in a very unflattering light.

184,"Ugh. I had high hopes for this. It's been on my TBR list for almost as long as I've been reading HR, and I was hoping it would make me appreciate Julia Quinn fangirling. It didn't. The worst part? It started out really great for me. I liked both characters from the get-go, and there was cuteness and fluff and lots of potential. Until there wasn't. Enter a horrendously awful older brother with a tendency toward violence, the H being resolutely opposed to marriage for a pretty stupid (slightly understandable but still really stupid reason)- so much so that he'd rather die at one point than marry a girl he actually likes, an incredibly melodramatic duel-that-wasn't, and an h who is stupid enough to think it is possible and okay to change a man. By the end of the book, I didn't like anyone, and events happened that pretty much disgusted me. I think the subject has already been thrown out there and discussed fully, but I am not okay with lack of consent in any situation. Ever. Male or female, no matter what the act or situation is, I can't condone lack of consent. I don't care if Simon's reasoning was stupid and selfish and only hurting himself by trying to hurt his dead father, he still said no. And yeah, I know he consented to what they were doing, but he definitely did not to what Daphne did at the end. That was downright despicable. Daphne was horrendous and there is no excuse for what she did. From then on, I checked out. Worse still is that it was soon forgotten and forgiven, and Simon was deeply in love and changed his opinion pretty darn quickly. No. Sorry Julia Quinn, Daphne's actions shouldn't have been rewarded by eventually getting everything she wanted. I don't like to further the narrative that you can fundamentally change a person if you try hard enough or make them love you. It's a dangerous and reckless idea that doesn't work. The characters here- yuck. I liked Simon for a lot of the book, but he had his ""She's my wife; I'm in charge moments"", and he also was really stupid to get sucked into getting married if he didn't want to in the first place. Kind of unrealistic. His reasoning that he was going to stick it to his dead dad was pretty dumb, too. Daphne was awful from the moment that she got the idea in her head that maybe she could make Simon want kids and marriage. She seemed very selfish and spoiled. Her mother was ridiculous and infuriating, and her two oldest brothers were the worst type of machismo cliche. I'm not sure if I want to read any more of this series or not at this point. I settled on two stars, mainly because JQ's dialogue and interaction between Daphne and Simon at the onset of the book was the best of hers that I've read.

185,"""He's more myself than I am. Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same."" Shame on anyone who made me believe that this book was a mere romaticization of an abusive relationship, how else was Emily Bronte supposed to tell us that everything Catherine and Heathcliff stood for was twisted and not romantic at all? They made everyone's live miserable, people have died because these two histerics couldn't make peace with how messed up each other's understanding of romance was! Like, there's this Italian commercial, it is actually well-meaning, it is a campaign to encourage people to read. There's this girl, she's sitting in a cafe reading this passage of Wuthering Heights: ""Catherine made a spring, and he caught her, and they were locked in an embrace from which I thought my mistress would never be released alive."" She's all dreamy looking and when she's getting out she looks at this boy and he looks at her, they smile at each other and the message of it all I guess is saying that by falling in love with words you're inspired to fall in love with your surroundings as well. That's rather nice, if it weren't that I've never actually found true love this way... uhm, where were we? Right, Catherine and Heathcliff and their ability to make people fall in love. Except, that's not the whole truth? For instance, in this passage they're ardently hugging sure, but they're also cursing having driven one another to despair and in Catherine's case  to death! That passage is later followed by Heathcliff saying: ""You teach me now how cruel you've been - cruel and false. Why did you despise me? Why did you betray your own heart, Cathy? I have not one word of comfort. You deserve this. You have killed yourself. [...] I have not broken your heart - You have broken it; and in breaking it, you have broken mine."" If this inspires you romantic love you should sort out your priorities! I have no doubt that these two characters loved one another (a twisted kind of love, mind it!) but their love soaks with so much hatred as well that it shouldn't be that difficult to undestand that none of us should aspire to that life. And in no way did Ms Emily Bronte try to suggest that! Because of hatred, because of toxic feelings of vengeance, Heathcliff makes everybody's life a living nightmare. He dooms young lives to unhappiness, isolation and ignorance, he uses pshysical violence against anyone who doesn't respond well to his whims, he's a rude, wretched and cantankerous (I've always wanted to use that word, seems rather fitting in this case!) being and in no way does his love for Catherine redeem him. Quite the contrary I'd say. In Catherine Linton's words: ""Mr. Heathcliff you have nobody to love you; and, however miserable you make us, we shall still have the revenge of thinking that your cruelty arises from your greater misery. You are miserable, are you not? Lonely, like the devil, and envious like him? Nobody loves you - Nobody will cry for you when you die!"" And again, if that's still reedemable for you you should pick up a good dictionary! The mean of narration left me rather puzzled at times. The story is told by Ellen Dean, a servant who's served both Wuthering Heights and Thrushcross Grange. Sometimes her voice could take a voyeuristic turn that unsettled me (like, couples hugging and kissing and professing eternal love to each other while in the corner stands Nelly, staring at them memorizing every word and every movement. Naughty Nelly, naughty!!) Needless to say, I didn't think I would have ended up being so invested into this book, after Jane Eyre by the other Bronte sister I didn't think I was going to love it in the same way (which I didn't, I still do believe that Jane Eyre is a cut above Wuthering Heights anyway) but what's not to love about a book that has it all? There's a twisted romance, anti-heroes, a gothic setting, juicy family drama, so many dead people, ladies falling ill after having been yelled at just once, starcrossed lovers, a kidnapping, grouchy men that if given the right chance could be actually rather cute and, ghosts maybe? Don't let anyone fool you into believing that a work of literature is something that in reality is not, always check it out yourself to make sure, always!",5,history,"['soul', 'shame', 'believe', 'book', 'mere', 'romaticization', 'abusive', 'relationship', 'emily', 'bronte', 'suppose', 'tell', 'catherine', 'heathcliff', 'stand', 'twisted', 'romantic', 'live', 'miserable', 'people', 'die', 'histeric', 'peace', 'mess', 'understanding', 'romance', 'like', 'italian', 'commercial', 'actually', 'mean', 'campaign', 'encourage', 'people', 'read', 'girl', 'sit', 'cafe', 'read', 'passage', 'wuthering_heights', 'catherine', 'spring', 'catch', 'lock', 'embrace', 'think', 'mistress', 'release', 'alive', 'dreamy', 'look', 'get', 'look', 'boy', 'look', 'smile', 'message', 'guess', 'say', 'fall_love', 'word', 'inspire', 'fall_love', 'surrounding', 'nice', 'actually', 'find', 'true', 'love', 'way', 'uhm', 'right', 'catherine', 'heathcliff', 'ability', 'people', 'fall_love', 'truth', 'instance', 'passage', 'ardently', 'hug', 'sure', 'curse', 'having', 'drive', 'despair', 'catherine', 'case', 'death', 'passage', 'later', 'follow', 'heathcliff', 'say', 'teach', 'cruel', 'cruel', 'false', 'despise', 'betray', 'heart', 'cathy', 'word', 'comfort', 'deserve', 'kill', 'break_heart', 'break', 'break', 'break', 'inspire', 'romantic', 'love', 'sort', 'priority', 'doubt', 'character', 'love', 'twisted', 'kind', 'love', 'mind', 'love', 'soak', 'hatred', 'difficult', 'undestand', 'aspire', 'life', 'way', 'ms', 'emily', 'bronte', 'try', 'suggest', 'hatred', 'toxic', 'feeling', 'vengeance', 'heathcliff', 'make', 'everybody', 'life', 'live', 'nightmare', 'doom', 'young', 'life', 'unhappiness', 'isolation', 'ignorance', 'use', 'pshysical', 'violence', 'respond', 'whim', 'rude', 'wretched', 'cantankerous', 'want', 'use', 'word', 'fitting', 'case', 'way', 'love', 'catherine', 'redeem', 'contrary', 'catherine', 'linton', 'word', 'heathcliff', 'love', 'miserable', 'shall', 'revenge', 'think', 'cruelty', 'arise', 'great', 'misery', 'miserable', 'lonely', 'like', 'devil', 'envious', 'like', 'love', 'cry', 'die', 'reedemable', 'pick', 'good', 'dictionary', 'mean', 'narration', 'leave', 'puzzled', 'time', 'story', 'tell', 'ellen', 'dean', 'servant', 'serve', 'wuthering_heights', 'thrushcross', 'grange', 'voice', 'voyeuristic', 'turn', 'unsettle', 'like', 'couple', 'hug', 'kiss', 'profess', 'eternal', 'love', 'corner', 'stand', 'nelly', 'stare', 'memorize', 'word', 'movement', 'naughty', 'nelly', 'naughty', 'needless', 'think', 'end', 'invested', 'book', 'jane_eyre', 'bronte', 'sister', 'think', 'go', 'love', 'way', 'believe', 'jane_eyre', 'cut', 'wuthering_heights', 'love', 'book', 'twisted', 'romance', 'anti', 'hero', 'gothic', 'setting', 'juicy', 'family', 'drama', 'dead', 'people', 'lady', 'fall', 'ill', 'having', 'yell', 'starcrossed', 'lover', 'kidnapping', 'grouchy', 'man', 'give', 'right', 'chance', 'actually', 'cute', 'ghost', 'maybe', 'let', 'fool', 'believe', 'work', 'literature', 'reality', 'check', 'sure']"
186,"** 3 1/2 stars ** Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet by Jamie Ford follows the life of Henry Lee during 1942 and 1986 in Seattle, Washington. Henry is a first-generation Chinese American whose father's heart is still in China. Henry is sent to an all-white school on scholarship because his father wants Henry to ""be American"". While there, Henry befriends a Japanese girl named Keiko who is also accepted at the school on scholarship. Henry knows his friendship with this young girl will upset his father, but having been the only student of color at Reiner Elementary, Henry allows his loneliness and need of a friend to overcome his prejudices. When Keiko is forced to relocate to an internment camp, Henry is devastated but determined to not let their friendship die. Forty years later new owners are renovating the Panama Hotel in Seattle when belongings of Japanese families during the 'war years' are found. Henry has recently lost his wife, Ethel, to cancer and these findings bring back a flood of old memories and longings. He doesn't want to disrespect the memory of his late wife and doesn't want to hurt his son who loved Ethel very much, but his need to revisit his past and his love for Keiko win out in the end and have surprising outcomes that Henry never imagined could happen. I typically have a difficult time reading period pieces because of my lack of knowledge of history. The author, however, did a very good job of explaining events and the culture of the time; I had no difficulty understanding what was happening or being able to visualize the story in my mind. The story, however, was very slow to get going for me. It was a good 100 pages in before things started to pick up and I really was interested in seeing what may happen next. I'm listing my pros and cons as spoilers because I don't want to ruin the story for those of you who may not have read this book yet. Pros * This book does an excellent job of showing that racism exists in many forms and people can too often hold prejudices against an entire people because of the deeds of a select few. * The author's research of 1940s Seattle culture is evident; he able to describe details to the reader that brings the book to life. * Prior to reading this book, I honestly had very little knowledge of the Japanese interment camps. I knew they had existed during WWII, but that was about it. This book is in no way an extensive text on what life inside these camps was like, but it does give the reader a glimpse. Cons * As previously stated, I found this book very difficult to get into. I contemplated abandoning it, but decided to hang on. * Although I know that love has no age, I found it very difficult to believe that two twelve-year olds could have such deep feelings for each other. Perhaps it was the difficulty of being together that pushed them closer to each other... or perhaps the extreme circumstances of the time... but the depth of love was a little unbelievable. * Although the internet did exist in 1986, it's very hard to believe that Marty was in an online support group and used the internet to locate Keiko on the opposite side of the country. * Although CDs did exist and were used in 1986, it was hard to believe this would be the suggested form of reformatting a record instead of a cassette tape.",3,history,"['star', 'hotel', 'corner', 'bitter', 'sweet', 'jamie', 'ford', 'follow', 'life', 'henry', 'lee', 'seattle', 'washington', 'henry', 'generation', 'chinese', 'american', 'father', 'heart', 'china', 'henry', 'send', 'white', 'school', 'scholarship', 'father', 'want', 'henry', 'american', 'henry', 'befriend', 'japanese', 'girl', 'name', 'keiko', 'accept', 'school', 'scholarship', 'henry', 'know', 'friendship', 'young', 'girl', 'upset', 'father', 'having', 'student', 'color', 'reiner', 'elementary', 'henry', 'allow', 'loneliness', 'need', 'friend', 'overcome', 'prejudice', 'keiko', 'force', 'relocate', 'internment', 'camp', 'henry', 'devastate', 'determined', 'let', 'friendship', 'die', 'year_later', 'new', 'owner', 'renovate', 'panama', 'hotel', 'seattle', 'belonging', 'japanese', 'family', 'war', 'year', 'find', 'henry', 'recently', 'lose', 'wife', 'ethel', 'cancer', 'finding', 'bring', 'flood', 'old', 'memory', 'longing', 'want', 'disrespect', 'memory', 'late', 'wife', 'want', 'hurt', 'son', 'love', 'ethel', 'need', 'revisit', 'past', 'love', 'keiko', 'win', 'end', 'surprising', 'outcome', 'henry', 'imagine', 'happen', 'typically', 'difficult', 'time', 'read', 'period', 'piece', 'lack', 'knowledge', 'history', 'author', 'good_job', 'explain', 'event', 'culture', 'time', 'difficulty', 'understand', 'happen', 'able', 'visualize', 'story', 'mind', 'story', 'slow', 'go', 'good', 'page', 'thing', 'start', 'pick', 'interested', 'see', 'happen', 'list', 'pro', 'con', 'spoiler', 'want', 'ruin', 'story', 'read', 'book', 'pro', 'book', 'excellent_job', 'show', 'racism', 'exist', 'form', 'people', 'hold', 'prejudice', 'entire', 'people', 'deed', 'select', 'author', 'research', 'seattle', 'culture', 'evident', 'able', 'describe', 'detail', 'reader', 'bring', 'book', 'life', 'prior', 'read', 'book', 'honestly', 'little', 'knowledge', 'japanese', 'interment', 'camp', 'know', 'exist', 'wwii', 'book', 'way', 'extensive', 'text', 'life', 'inside', 'camp', 'like', 'reader', 'glimpse', 'con', 'previously', 'state', 'find', 'book', 'difficult', 'contemplate', 'abandon', 'decide', 'hang', 'know', 'love', 'age', 'find', 'difficult', 'believe', 'year_old', 'deep', 'feeling', 'difficulty', 'push', 'close', 'extreme', 'circumstance', 'time', 'depth', 'love', 'little', 'unbelievable', 'internet', 'exist', 'hard', 'believe', 'marty', 'online', 'support', 'group', 'internet', 'locate', 'keiko', 'opposite', 'country', 'cd', 'exist', 'hard', 'believe', 'suggest', 'form', 'reformatte', 'record', 'instead', 'cassette', 'tape']"
187,"4 1/2 stars How do you rate a book such as this? It is hard to separate the quality of the writing from the subject matter of the novel, but I'll try. Here goes: *	Prose - Excellent The author paints pictures with her words. e.g. ""The stairs unfold from the ceiling like a gentleman extending his hand."" ""...Paris was a woman screaming."" ""...a crowd of drab-eyed, dark-clothed people who looked like they belonged in an Edvard Munch painting."" *	Clarity - Fair I reread the first 3 chapters more than once, trying to establish a timeline in my head. Ages of the girls were just not adding up for me. I also did not at first understand who owned Le Jardin. I later questioned why the girls had never before been there, since it had been their family's summer home. *	Subject Matter - Unratable Gut wrenching, dramatic, horrifying *	Emotional Impact - Intense I completely lost it at one point in the story, and wept. *	Enjoyment Level - I don't know I had a niggling sense of unease throughout the entire book, and was constantly in an uncomfortable state. (Not surprising given the subject matter.) But somehow I was compelled to keep on reading. *	Relatability - Nonexistent I cannot fathom the atrocities that can be perpetuated by mankind. I know that horrific actions have been (and still are) repeated over and over again throughout history, but they are occurring outside of my tiny little bubble, so seem less real to me. I cannot imagine living as these people did. *	Value of My Time - Excellent I consider reading this book to have been time well spent. Reviewing this is like trying to review 'The Diary of Anne Frank'. What can you possibly say? I'm glad I read it, I learned some things I never knew before, and it put my privileged life into perspective. Read with SBC book club September 2015 NOTE: For those interested in some research I did related to this book *	Andree de Jongh was the inspiration for Isabelle aka The Nightingale - The Seattle Times The subject of ""The Nightingale"" was an outgrowth of research (Kristin) Hannah had done for her earlier novel ""Winter Garden,"" when she came across information about a Resistance heroine -- the 19-year-old Belgian woman Andree de Jongh. This brave teenager, inspired in turn by the earlier World War I heroine Edith Cavell, established the Comet Escape Line, a secret network of people who risked their lives to help Allied servicemen escape over the Pyrenees to Spain. De Jongh's story inspired Hannah to conduct further research into the French Resistance, finding stories about women who had put themselves and their children in peril by hiding Jewish families. And de Jongh became the model for Isabelle, the younger sister, who, as ""the Nightingale,"" personally led downed Allied pilots over the mountains to safety. *	An Obituary for Andree de Jongh - The Guardian Countess Andree de Jongh, who has died aged 90, created one of the most effective escape lines for allied airmen out of Nazi-occupied Europe during the Second World War before she was caught, interrogated by the Gestapo and sent to a concentration camp. Later, she devoted the rest of her working life to the treatment of African lepers. De Jongh was born in occupied Brussels in 1916, a year after the British Red Cross hospital matron Edith Cavell was shot by the Germans for helping some 200 First World War soldiers to escape from Belgium to the neutral Netherlands. The story deeply impressed the young Andree. The younger daughter of schoolmaster Frederic de Jongh, she was 24 and working as a commercial artist in Malmedy at the time of the Belgian surrender to the Nazis. She threw up her job, moved to Brussels and became a nurse. Some of her patients were British servicemen, whom she helped to send letters home via the Red Cross. Entirely on her own initiative, De Jongh began to make discreet soundings among friends and contacts with a view to copying her heroine, Cavell. Circumstances for such activity were much harder in the Second World War than in the first: this time, the Netherlands had been overrun, while the whole of France was under direct or indirect Nazi control, divided between a German-occupied zone and a collaborationist Vichy. The construction of what was called the Comet escape line was methodical from the outset. De Jongh arranged a series of safe houses in and around Brussels, where evading soldiers and aircrew could await escort out of the country along a complicated route. She found plenty of helpers, even though such activity was subject to the death penalty. Her first escape group comprised 11 men, who were sent via Paris and further Nazi-occupied French territory (which included the whole of the Atlantic coast) to the Pyrenees, which they crossed on foot into neutral but pro-Nazi Spain. This first sortie ended badly. All members of the party were arrested by the Spanish authorities; only two ultimately managed to reach England. So De Jongh decided to lead the next group, two Belgian soldiers and a Scot, to Spain herself. They eventually stole into the British consulate in Bilbao, a success that proved to be the breakthrough. Now De Jongh was able to persuade British officials to provide financial and logistical backing, and the Comet line got the support of MI9, the intelligence branch set up to bring home stranded servicemen from occupied territory. The desk officer who oversaw support for Comet was the later Tory politician Airey Neave, who himself had escaped back to England from Colditz. For a while, Comet flourished alongside another Belgian escape line, known as Pat, which managed to send some 600 men to Britain before it was betrayed and wound up in 1942. Comet carried on until the allied armies freed Belgium in 1944, in spite of disaster in January 1943. De Jongh evaded mounting German suspicions, which had led to a number of betrayals and arrests among network members in Belgium, by moving her headquarters to Paris. On one occasion, Comet rescued a seven-man RAF bomber crew and got them all to Gibraltar in a week. Altogether the organization was responsible for the safe return of some 800 men. But on her 33rd run to Spain, while leading three RAF men at the beginning of 1944, de Jongh and her charges were arrested in France. She was interrogated by the Gestapo, to whom she told the unvarnished truth: the whole thing had been her idea from the start. Unwilling to believe her, the Germans spared her life but sent her to the notorious women's concentration camp at Ravens-bruck. She sidestepped further interrogation by disappearing into the general prison population. Her father had also worked with Comet, but was betrayed, arrested and shot in June 1943. After the war, De Jongh went to the [then Belgian] Congo to work as a nurse in a leper colony. Following Congolese independence, she undertook similar work in Ethiopia. For her wartime heroism, she was awarded the George Medal by the British, the Medal of Freedom by the Americans, an honorary commission in the Belgian army and was created a countess by the King of the Belgians. Andree de Jongh, nurse and resistance heroine, born November 30 1916; died October 13 2007 *	Operation Spring Wind During the nights of July 16 and July 17, 1942, an incident occurred, which is now called ""La Rafle du Vel d'Hiv"" - The Great Raid of the Vel d'Hiv. (The Velodrome d'Hiver was a stadium in Paris designed for bike races. The French destroyed the stadium after the war). This police operation had been organized after several discussions between the government of Petain and the Nazi occupation administration. The code name of this operation was ""Vent printanier"" (Spring Wind) and all the arrests were made by the French police under the control of French police officials. Originally, only the Jews who were older than age 16 had to be arrested. It was under the proposal of Prime Minister Laval that all the children were arrested. More than 12,800 (3,031 men, 5,802 women and 4,051 children aged between 2 and 12) were transferred to the Velodrome d'Hiver. The children were kept there for 5 miserable days without any food or medical care and then they were transferred to Drancy, Beaune-la-Rolande or Pithiviers. The children were separated from their parents by the French police immediately after their arrival in Drancy. The parents were transported to Auschwitz and gassed. The children stayed in Drancy, sometimes for weeks, without any proper care or adequate food. Several babies and very young children died in Drancy due to the lack of care and the brutality of the French guards. Finally, they were all transported to Auschwitz and gassed upon their arrival. More than 6,000 Jewish children from all the regions of France were arrested and transported to their deaths between July 17 and September 30, 1942. The truth remains that it was the French police who implemented - and indeed exceeded - the German plans for Operation Spring Wind. Originally, French Jews and all those under 18 were to have been spared. But, eager to meet the wildly unrealistic Nazi target of 25,000 foreign-born adult Jews, zealous French officials rounded up everyone they could lay their hands on. It took until 1995 for the French state to acknowledge its role. ""Yes,"" said Jacques Chirac then, soon after he was first elected president of the Republic, ""the criminal madness of the occupier was seconded by the French, by the French state, everyone knows it. That day, France accomplished something irreparable.""",5,history,"['star', 'rate', 'book', 'hard', 'separate', 'quality', 'writing', 'subject_matter', 'novel', 'try', 'go', 'prose', 'excellent',

188,"Solid with a few incredibly tense scenes. The actual story itself and most of the characters are pretty generic. how many of these mysteries use the old, white, state Senator as the bad guy? It's like all of them I think. As soon as you hear ""senator"" you know everything besides a few details. The mix of the setting and the lead protagonists is what makes it bearable. There are a couple of scenes between the white cops and a black farmer that are great(and have absolutely no parallel to today, right?)

189,"3.5 Stars - Great book. It took me a few chapters to get into the story and the characters - just about everything. The opening is fine but that's it, just fine. I wasn't pulled into the story in any way. Mediocre may be too strong of a word for the first three to four chapters but it definitely teeters on mediocre. There are many different ways to draw me into a book but mostly I have to feel some sort of connection to the characters. I didn't feel that in the first few chapters here. Honestly, I don't know why I kept reading but ultimately I'm glad I did. As for the characters, there's not one character that I liked but I didn't necessarily dislike or hate them either (except for Hatsumomo and Mother, those two I despise). Sayuri isn't even that great of a person, and yet I was rooting for her, even through her stupid mistakes. I think part of the problem with the characters is that the situations they're in and the culture they're in are just so different than anything I've read before. I must sadly say that my reading experience tends to be heavy on the Western Hemisphere. I think I need to adapt my reading skills to really appreciate characters from other cultures. I say all that, and that doesn't mean the characters aren't well written. They are impeccably written and I can see that. I just don't like the characters as people. I don't like them but I do respect them, well I respect most of them. Part of the problem is that the whole subject matter was new to me so I was so focused on grasping certain concepts and understanding the Geisha experience/life that I forgot the little things. So much of the character ""issue"" is on me. But some of it is on the author because I'm not that terrible of a reader. One of the good things about the characters were their complex backstories and that for most of them, I could sympathize or at least understand why they were the way they were. For instance, Sayuri's character development is fascinating to watch. Sure, she isn't perfect but who is? I can relate to certain feelings of hers and that helps create a bond between myself and the main character. Though, I did always feel a certain disconnect. I will say that the author created someone, in my opinion, that is purely evil - Hatsumomo. I know her circumstances and life may not have always been kind to her but I'm a firm believer that people have choices. They can't control what happens to them, but they can control how they act. Hatsumomo chose incorrectly. This may be a bit of a stretch but since I just finished Rebecca, I saw some major title characters between the title character and Hatsumomo. Both absolutely beautiful bitches that could fool people into believe they were better people than they actually were - less for for Hatsumomo at the end of the book though. The writing is fine and really plays to the scenes. By that I mean that when the author needs to be descriptive he uses beautiful, flowery language and when he needs to be more concise he molds his words to do just that. The author really knows how to form phrases and sentences and so on to create scenes. My main issue is that he doesn't know how to break-up paragraphs. If I was taught anything in school, it's that you can't let a paragraph go on for too long because you lose your reader and this book certainly proves that point. It was straining on my eyes and I eventually had to go back over and read some of those arduous passages again. I thought the ending came up very fast. That is to say, that when Sayuri and the Chairman finally ""got together"" there were only a few chapters left. And that was even cut short because of Sayuri's move to New York. I understand that this book is supposed to focus on her life as a Geisha, but I still felt short-changed. When I finished, I can't say I felt satisfied. It appears that Sayuri is happy, or at least content, with where life eventually brought here but I wasn't satisfied as a reader. That's probably because I wanted Sayuri and the Chairman to be together forever, as the cliche goes (even though I never got of the ridiculous age difference. Creeps me out a little)  but even as I write it I know that's just not how the Geisha culture is. Overall, I can happily recommend this book. It's a great book and even though I'm not sure I actually liked it I appreciated it and the storyline.",4,history,"['star', 'great', 'book', 'take', 'chapter', 'story', 'character', 'opening', 'fine', 'fine', 'pull', 'story', 'way', 'mediocre', 'strong', 'word', 'chapter', 'definitely', 'teeter', 'mediocre', 'different', 'way', 'draw', 'book', 'feel', 'sort', 'connection', 'character', 'feel', 'chapter', 'honestly', 'know', 'keep', 'read', 'ultimately', 'glad', 'character', 'character', 'like', 'necessarily', 'dislike', 'hate', 'hatsumomo', 'mother', 'despise', 'sayuri', 'great', 'person', 'root', 'stupid', 'mistake', 'think', 'problem', 'character', 'situation', 'culture', 'different', 'read', 'sadly', 'reading', 'experience', 'tend', 'heavy', 'western', 'hemisphere', 'think', 'need', 'adapt', 'reading', 'skill', 'appreciate', 'character', 'culture', 'mean', 'character', 'write', 'impeccably', 'write', 'like', 'character', 'people', 'like', 'respect', 'respect', 'problem', 'subject_matter', 'new', 'focused', 'grasp', 'certain', 'concept', 'understand', 'geisha', 'experience', 'life', 'forget', 'little', 'thing', 'character', 'issue', 'author', 'terrible', 'reader', 'good', 'thing', 'character', 'complex', 'backstorie', 'sympathize', 'understand', 'way', 'instance', 'sayuri', 'character_development', 'fascinating', 'watch', 'sure', 'perfect', 'relate', 'certain', 'feeling', 'help', 'create', 'bond', 'main_character', 'feel', 'certain', 'disconnect', 'author', 'create', 'opinion', 'purely', 'evil', 'hatsumomo', 'know', 'circumstance', 'life', 'kind', 'firm', 'believer', 'people', 'choice', 'control', 'happen', 'control', 'act', 'hatsumomo', 'choose', 'incorrectly', 'bit', 'stretch', 'finish', 'rebecca', 'see', 'major', 'title', 'character', 'title', 'character', 'hatsumomo', 'absolutely', 'beautiful', 'bitch', 'fool', 'people', 'believe', 'well', 'people', 'actually', 'hatsumomo', 'end', 'book', 'writing', 'fine', 'play', 'scene', 'mean', 'author', 'need', 'descriptive', 'use', 'beautiful', 'flowery', 'language', 'need', 'concise', 'mold', 'word', 'author', 'know', 'form', 'phrase', 'sentence', 'create', 'scene', 'main', 'issue', 'know', 'break', 'paragraph', 'teach', 'school', 'let', 'paragraph', 'long', 'lose', 'reader', 'book', 'certainly', 'prove', 'point', 'strain', 'eye', 'eventually', 'read', 'arduous', 'passage', 'think', 'ending', 'come', 'fast', 'sayuri', 'chairman', 'finally', 'get', 'chapter', 'leave', 'cut', 'short', 'sayuri', 'new_york', 'understand', 'book', 'suppose', 'focus', 'life', 'geisha', 'feel', 'short', 'change', 'finish', 'feel', 'satisfied', 'appear', 'sayuri', 'happy', 'content', 'life', 'eventually', 'bring', 'satisfied', 'reader', 'probably', 'want', 'sayuri', 'chairman', 'forever', 'cliche', 'go', 'get', 'ridiculous', 'age', 'difference', 'creep', 'little', 'write', 'know', 'geisha', 'culture', 'overall', 'happily', 'recommend', 'book', 'great', 'book', 'sure', 'actually', 'like', 'appreciate', 'storyline']"
190,"Potential Spoilers!! Unless you are some kind saint, this book will PISS YOU OFF=( I loved how this story was going up until the last 100 pages or so, then it just fell to pieces and left me saying ""Huh?"" after every turn of the page. The Heroine acknowledges that she loves the hero and even feels really sorry for him, yet she goes on and on determined to get her revenge on him through an elaborate public humiliation. ""Oh, I love you terribly and know you've been mistreated, but I simply MUST destroy your life anyway."" WTF? It's like she has some kind of personality disorder or cognitive dissonance. Then, she changes her mind when he apologizes by telling her--wait for it!! !--everything she already knew! Wow. You just up and decide to change your mind because he laid it out neatly? What a moron. Then, the villain. Good grief. I don't know if this is an English thing or what (since Balogh is from Whales), but this whole ""turn the other cheek"" thing really should have its limits. I was so frustrated with how the villain was just getting off that I felt almost physically ill. <> The Hero was falsely accused of rape years ago, thus completely destroying his life. The poor guy had to flee the country and live in exile for 9 years. And why? Because the woman who accused him was a lesbian and would do anything to avoid getting married. Oh! That makes it okay! Yes, let's all just forgive her for something that quite possibly could have gotten an innocent man killed just because she was too much of a coward to refuse marriage on her own. Instead, she had to destroy an innocent man who had nothing to do with her personal problems. And the other characters are all like ""It was nine years ago. You need to forgive. Don't fill yourself with bitterness...."" Unbelievable! People say that hatred is a poison, but you know what else is a poison? Having the entire world brush off the fact that you have been betrayed and having to listen to them tell you to get over it. That will shrivel a person's heart to nothing. I was reminded of one of Balogh's earlier novels - Lord Carew's Bride - in which the terrible villain gets what's coming to him by being beaten to a near pulp. THAT is satisfying. THAT is reality. Not this sentimental ""turn the other cheek"" crap that does not work with normal people.

191,"I've already fallen in love with the first book in the Turner series, and I'm not even halfway through! Why, oh why, didn't I read it sooner? Why did I get such a wrong impression from the second book? Mark Turner is definitely more interesting in this book than in his own book(the second one: ""Unclaimed"")...HOW? A little bit of spoiler....Ash never suspecting that Margaret could actually bring him down to his knees... the Bam and the Whap.... :D :D :D Ash is literally crumpled on the floor....Oh, how I admire Margaret, and how I love Mark for confounding/tricking PLUS teasing his brother this way! I am grinning right now because of that, and I need to get back to that situation, as I'm currently reading this book and am only on page 85... ^__^ After finishing the whole book, my initial love has faded... Nope, I'm still too much taken with the Brothers Sinister series, no other historical romances can match their stories, apparently. Sigh. 2.75 stars. If I were to give a different rating to it, I would be lying. We can't help liking or less liking something, can we? The way the conflicts were solved near the end, they were ok-ish, but nothing quite surprising as Courtney Milan delivered in her other books. There is one character who I wanted to like so much, but he couldn't be fully redeemed: Richard. Well, I can hope he will change gradually... Having read Ash's and Mark's stories, I'm afraid to expect more for Smite.... It's the last chance. I want to like Smite's story, I really do. Don't get me wrong, I do adore the bond among the Turner brothers, it's just...with Unclaimed and Unveiled, what happened is this---I feel elated at the start, feel good throughout the second part of the journey, then the third portion tends to drag on, and the end comes a bit late, even though the end leaves no loose ties. I just can't connect with the romance as the story comes to the third part, they feel a bit too good and hastened to be real. I connected with the romance initially, but then, after a point, I couldn't connect anymore. It was just too easy. Especially after both Smite and Mark found out... And the way Ash acted after finding out. I'm sure there will be other readers who can connect with the romance till the end of the journey, but I couldn't be one of them(I tried.) For what it's worth, I liked Ash a lot for his bond with his brothers. Now, the only hope left is the last brother, Smite's story and the novellas.

194,"Hmm, this book felt awfully familiar and I can't help but wonder why. Maybe because it was more or less the same damn plot as THIEF OF SHADOWS, book four, in the Maiden Lane series. Oh there were obviously enough differences that it wasn't word for word the same, but ultimately (and literally) it was the same conflict but with new characters who happened to have some differing backstory. I almost convinced myself that Hoyt had to have this story follow Winter's due to the chronological order but like.. two years have elapsed between this book and the previous. So even that excuse doesn't hold water. Neither Godric nor Meg were very compelling characters. Mostly because they were both going through the motions of mourning and feeling guilty over their dead loves as they navigated the strange circumstance of being married years earlier in order to prevent Margaret from the shame of having a baby out of wedlock. It was a situation that might have been made interesting, or at least sympathetic, but neither character (either individually, or as a unit) interested me. The story was made worse by the fact that we went through the same motions regarding the Ghost of St Giles that we had just experienced and the big 'surprise' over the conspiracy from book four, which has a resurgence here, left me cold. Leaving me to wonder.. Why did we need to go back to this? We learned nothing new, not really, and overall I just wasn't interested in anything about this book.. except the thread featuring another character, who, in Hoyt's trademark way, will rise to prominence for book six. I'm very curious about Artemis and naturally it doesn't take a genius to see who she'll be paired up with. Nor what his secret is. There's been quite the trend on these ""big"" reveals and I'm hoping, maybe after book six?, we move on to something new because the revolving door of heroes playing the Ghost of St Giles is getting kind of tired now . Didn't think I'd rate a book lower than the 2.5 (rounded to a three) I'd given to book one after the whole Lazarus and his long silver hair disaster but 'lo and behold this one just didn't work for me.

197,"Entertaining light read. As seems to be common with the Essex sisters books, a great deal of time is spent checking in on various sisters - in this one (as the last), on Imogen, which is interesting and well-written but does take a lot of the emotional energy away from the romance we're reading about and put it into the romance we will be reading next. Imogen is busy swanning around and making everything about her - and the author is kind of doing the same. I also didn't love the plotline surrounding Rosy. It was cliched and really sad and far too easily resolved to feel realistic in the same way that the rest of the book feels realistic. And yes, this book, like many romance novels, is not really realistic - four sisters with horses for dowries have romances with handsome, eligible, wealthy peers! - but the emotions, and the emotional resolutions, feel realistic. The characters feel like real people, even if the plots don't seem like anything that would ever actually happen.

199,"Dear Lisa See, This is a pictorial representation of how I felt while reading your book: Shanghai - Angel Island section: \(^o^)/ San Francisco, the early years: (-_-;) Joy grows up: ""(o`Min 'o)no It started out so well. Sure, Pearl and May were sheltered, spoiled and selfish. But that's the start of a heroic arc, yes? A character has to start low so when she becomes mature and generous, it is clear how far she has come. The attack on Shanghai was terrifying and horrific. I loved how the Chin matriarch had more backbone and intelligence than either of her daughters ever dreamed she possessed. I very, very much liked the Shanghai section of your book. I'm not saying that I liked reading about the horrible things that happened to the Chin family. But the novel had a sense of urgency and drama and potential that it quickly lost once the girls got to America. Ms. See, I know the tragedy of Chinese immigrants for far too much of the 19th and 20th centuries (blatant, persistent racism that extended into the lifetimes of those still alive today) is near and dear to your heart. But there is a place between dogma and silence where subtlety lies and you have not found it. There are certain scenes in the book that are not part of the organic stories of the characters. They are there because you want to SHOW the reader another aspect of white racism against those of Chinese descent. Example: Pearl gets a job in a department store. This is good, because she has spent far too much of her time in San Fran whining and refusing to move beyond her porch. Her English is perfect and she is apparently a natural born saleswoman. Of course, she hits a glass ceiling because she's Chinese. A paragraph later, she's left her job. Why? It's never explained. Probably because your point is made: Chinese were discriminated against in employment. Now that you've shown that, Pearl never again uses her perfect English (or any of the other languages she's fluent in) or her apparent innate selling skills, even when the family is in need of money. This happens again when Pearl and Sam want to enroll Joy in a white school. The kindergarten teacher is a racist and poor Joy is so mercilessly harassed they give up and move her to the local Chinese school. This could be a normal plotpoint, but it was so brief and random it felt more like another message: Chinese were discriminated against in public schools. I'm not saying that you aren't writing about important messages. I'm saying that shoe-horning in messages whether or not they are natural to the characters and storyline leaves a bitter aftertaste and actually distracts from what you are trying to say. I am also sad that you managed to waste Sam. He is the perfect set-up for a romantic hero: (1) even Pearl admits he's handsome and he's buff from all that manual labor (2) he has a tragic backstory (3) he loves his daughter and cares for Pearl (4) he is patient, kind, loyal, hard-working and good. But, no, he is male and therefore can never develop into a full character. Can you PLEASE write a male who is not a place holder or a prop? I know you are all about sisterhood and female friendship rah, rah, but you can do that AND have a romance. I WANTED to fall in love with Sam and have Pearl and him have some real connection, but after his tragic backstory confession he doesn't really do much again until the end. If you need some ideas for how to write good romantic interests, try Isabel Allende's Daughter of Fortune, because I was ready to marry Tao Chi'en myself when I read that book. Also, what is up with you writing such annoying protagonists? Pearl is Lily all over again. Pearl and Lily are the same selfish, passive-aggressive, cold, bitter, whiny, obstinate woman. Is Pearl actually Lily reincarnated? I would have much rather have had May as the narrator. She might've be flighty and selfish, but at least she did more than mope around, feel like a martyr and complain. This applies to Joy. I know she was your representation of the entitlement and rebellion of first generation Chinese-Americans. But am I SUPPOSED to want to bitch-slap sense into her? She takes after her mother in the whining department, but instead of being annoyingly passive she is stupidly naive, which makes her brash. I hope she DOES feel bad about what happened to Sam! And how am I supposed to like a character that throws away the college education her parents scrimped and saved for, on top of stealing her family's life savings? I actually hope she is a victim of Mao's Cultural Revolution. It would serve her right to be killed because of her own stupid fantasies. I cannot believe there is a whole other book on Joy. Why? Why?!?!?. I would declare that I won't read it, but I can't promise I wouldn't be lying. I got through almost all of Philippa Gregory's Tudor series despite raving about how horrible they were (well, The Queen's Fool was pretty good). I like to finish what I start, whether that's wise or not. And please, for the love of God, please kill the term ""the husband-wife thing."" I accepted it with Lily, who was a sheltered country girl. Maybe that's the term they really used, I don't know. But Pearl was loudly and proudly cosmopolitan. She had American friends and watched American movies. She had perfect English. She would know more ways to allude to sex. ""The husband-wife thing"" makes my skin crawl, because it sounds like the speaker is not all mentally there. I think you are a talented writer, Ms. See. And you have probably already forgotten more than I will ever know about the history of China and Chinese immigrants. So I hope you can expand your focus a little, throw in some romance (or at least a male character that's more than ""the husband""/""the father-in-law"", etc.) and not show your work so much. I have high hopes for you.

200,"Sometimes I have to re-taste foods that I don't like to see if my opinion has changed. I have done this twice in the past week, with ketchup and celery. I have avoided both for years. Then, well. I guess I needed to remind myself that I hate ketchup, and I hate celery, and that I am correct in avoiding them, and that I should continue to avoid them. I think you can see where I am going with this. I guess I am in a ""opinion re-calibration"" mode. And to be honest, I have found in every case that my opinions were fine. I do, in fact, dislike sprawling epics with heroic characters! I do (yes, currently) dislike wordy, detailed descriptions! I do dislike romance! I do dislike boring, Mary Sue-ish characters! I do! I do i do! So I really had to force myself through this book, because I stupidly decided it was going to be the book club read for this month. I really, really disliked it. However, I honestly don't think it was a terrible worthless POS. I do honestly think it is a really weird book, like surprisingly weird (why did no one warn me about the magic-healing-erotic-dream-drugged-sex-fight? I mean. Ok, whatever rocks your boat. I just haven't seen the ""magic healing sex"" trope done like, seriously in years. Here's a quote from that TVtropes article: ""In Fan Fic parlance, this is often called the 'magical healing cock' and mocked, as it is often Narm (or deeply offensive) when, as all too often, the magical healing cock is used as instant therapy for a rape victim."" I read a TON of slash fan fiction. So I've been aware and wary of this problematic (I know, the word is overused, sorry) romance cliche for years, and seeing it show up here was like, uhhh wut. Even at the book club meeting, another woman brought it up as being the only part of the book that made her truly uncomfortable, before I had mentioned anything. ), with scarily intimidating online fans.

201,"This is one weird book. For about the first 60% it was feeling like the best I'd read this year, but having finished, my feelings are mixed. The narrator, Rose, works a typist in a New York City police precinct in the 1920s. When the precinct starts cracking down on speakeasies, a new typist is hired: the glamorous Odalie, who seems to be Rose's opposite in every way. Rose is an orphan who rents half a bedroom at a cheap boardinghouse and lives a solitary life, and she quickly falls under Odalie's spell, though she realizes Odalie's behavior deviates from her own strict sense of morality. To say more would be to spoil it; though between the extensive foreshadowing and reading reviews beforehand, I found the story to develop as I'd predicted it, the plot still kept me enthralled. So, the good stuff. The book is very well-written, with a strong voice, and the obvious unreliability of Rose's narration is engaging and keeps the reader guessing. The author keeps the tension simmering even through fairly mundane events, and while the pacing is on the slow side, it fits the story well. Rose and Odalie's relationship rings true, though it's evident from the beginning that it's not as healthy as Rose would like to believe. It's quite an atmospheric book, bringing Prohibition-era New York to life: the speakeasies of course are fun, as is seeing how the police station operates. The characters and settings are vivid; I'm inclined to call the book cinematic, although not in an entirely complimentary way: with the exception of Rose--who has enough complexity to share--it never felt like there was much to the characters beneath the surface. Even Odalie seems more glamor than substance, although perhaps that's intentional: she's likely sociopathic, incapable of affection, remorse, or change, and therefore inherently hollow. Unfortunately, some of my interest was lost when Rose and Odalie spend several chapters vacationing at a socialite couple's seaside mansion; I find rich people throwing parties to be one of the most boring subjects ever, although I realize that's idiosyncratic and if you're interested in this book for the Great Gatsby-like setting, it won't bother you in the least. And then there's the ending. It's a puzzle, and if you like endings that throw the entire book into question, you'll eat it up. As for me, I prefer the sort of unreliable narrators who allow readers to figure out what's going on by reading between the lines, and the possibility that Rose was delusional or lying the entire time just left me baffled. Neither of the most obvious explanations for the book really make sense. One is that Rose and Odalie were either the same person all along or that Rose made Odalie up. Which I don't much like because it throws out the entire story, most of which is about Rose and Odalie's relationship, and much of it featuring the two of them in the company of others, who do in fact behave as if there are two different women there. The other is that the story did mostly take place as Rose narrated it, and Odalie set Rose up. But then, how to explain those weird scenes where Rose seemed to be turning into Odalie? And if Rose's face was splashed all over the newspapers as ""Ginevra""/Odalie, surely someone who knew one or the other would've come forward to point out the mistake. In the end, I'm glad I read this, because it's well-written and I found the story and its narrator captivating.

203,"After making a review of Bridgerons #8 (On The Way To The Wedding), I was appalled, yes that's the right term, to realize that I haven't read Francesca's story, and upon reading it's blurb, I know why. It was a little taboo in a way that might cross the borders of cheating...And though I do read taboo stories(as long as it aesthetically written), I hate it to be accompanied by cheating, especially that John, Francesca's deceased husband was obviously a good person. I hate cheating in stories... It's my pet peeve, I know I shouldn't coz it's somehow common in Romance but it does bother me. And my Psychologist and I have been talking about it actually. I really weird about it, I mean not normally. Anyway, Michael and Francesca proved me wrong. Their story is actually one of the best in this series. Both characters are relatable. I felt Farannie's pain and grief. And Michael. I actually teared more than few times, everytime he was hurt. I just can imagine how awful, how hard it is to be in his shoes. It was very painful. Even after they get involved sexually and get married , one might think finally he'd be happy somehow. He's still hurting. But he has no choice but take whatever he can get from Frannie, no matter how little it is. I totally understand why Frannie couldn't jump into Michael's proposal, or even to the idea of being involved with him. Maybe most of us don't know, or we want to think that we do but some widows, especially the ones who had a perfect relationship with their late husband, might feel like Frannie did. It was normal for them. Also, I was laughing at the chapter where Michael was courting Frannie. It must be frustrating in Frannie's part but it was funny to the reader. ANd the sex scenes....Wooooow!!!! Seriously Julia Quinn....In a good way...this is the first time I read something from this author with a nonvirgin heroine and I must say,,,GOOD JOB!! !..I think it was just fitting that their sex scenes were way too hotter than the others.

204,"This is an excellent, excellent book, and one best discovered without much information going in. If you are intrigued by the synopsis, and like to read about vivid characters, strong female friendships, and/or desperate stakes, I highly suggest you give it a try. Some people report being bored by the beginning, which involves a lot of descriptions of flying, but I was hooked from the first page. Verity's voice leaps off the page at you, and only grows stronger as her narrative continues. The rest of my praise is going under a spoiler tag. I really suggest you don't click unless you've read the book. Based on the reviews I'd seen, I was expecting some huge revelation halfway through. Well, yes. Sort of. But I wasn't actually that shocked to hear Maddie had survived. No, what got me was the slow unraveling. The little details, the hints that Julie's account wasn't as straightforward as it seemed. I actually noted the underlining as I was reading, but I didn't see how everything would come together. When I finally did, it was beautiful. Oh, and then there was the plot twist that took my heart and stomped all over it. So, 1/2 I guess. God, there's so much to love about this book. Julie and Maddie do make a spectacular team, and Wein absolutely nails their voices. The time period, too - I really felt like I was immersed in WWII-era Britain. And the tension is sky high - especially in the second half. Not a moment drags, and the sense of danger is palpable. And I almost cried when...well. If you've read it you can guess.

205,"I really wanted to like this more than I did. I had high hopes in the beginning, because the leads didn't meet and immediately want to jump in bed. It took them time to fall in love. However, in doing so, they were incredibly dull. Hardly anything interesting happened in the story, and by the last few chapters, I was more than ready for it to be over. Usually I don't mind if the leads don't communicate, but for some reason it really annoyed me here. For example, when Eve encountered her former lover, John, a man she was supposed to marry, Aidan sees them together and begins torturing himself about how Eve must long for the affections of her lover. It was too much angst. Later, John vows to have Eve again and then that whole thing is just dropped. I just thought it was pointless drama. I'm sad I didn't like this more, as it put me off reading about the rest of the Bedwyn clan (although I think I'll make an exception for Wulf, if only because he's super icy).",2,history,"['want', 'like', 'high_hope', 'beginning', 'lead', 'meet', 'immediately', 'want', 'jump', 'bed', 'take', 'time', 'fall_love', 'incredibly', 'dull', 'hardly', 'interesting', 'happen', 'story', 'chapter', 'ready', 'usually', 'mind', 'lead', 'communicate', 'reason', 'annoy', 'example', 'eve', 'encounter', 'lover', 'john', 'man', 'suppose', 'marry', 'aidan', 'see', 'begin', 'torture', 'eve', 'long', 'affection', 'lover', 'angst', 'later', 'john', 'vow', 'eve', 'thing', 'drop', 'think', 'pointless', 'drama', 'sad', 'like', 'read', 'rest', 'bedwyn', 'clan', 'think', 'exception', 'wulf', 'super', 'icy']"

On a dark drizzly fog London 1818 night, why does Justine, shopkeeper (few years retired French spy) collapse on home doorstep of Sir Adrian Hawkhurst, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of..., long years Head of British Intelligence Service? She bleeds to death from poisoned knife owned by aforesaid lord. Hop back decades ago, at the height of their hormonal heat and beginning of their espionage careers, two teens from opposite sides collide. Owl, Paris aristo forced whore, enlists Hawker, slum Rookery killer thief, to rescue Caches, children trained by French torture to infiltrate England as moles p56. Pax plays backup; three (one later called Jane Cardiff  stay behind; seeds of 1818 trouble are planted. X-rated, ""There was no feeling sweeter than a fine pair of lockpicks between the fingers. Except maybe a girl's breasts. Maybe the flower between her legs. That was the sweetest toy in the world"" ""on the job"" p63. Bunny-like, couple hippety passionately, powers professional and personal rise higher to climax that tears them apart - (tumbles and) saving Napoleon. Timeline hoppetys. But author is appropriately named (Bourne spy thrillers - books and films), this goes beyond standard romance, historical, or suspense. Thus despite her creations resemblances, I love their representations and sharing their excitement, on the page. Persiflage attends every encounter. Midway, Adrian catches Justine visiting her sister, adopted into England p101. J: ""You will let me go, of course. I am not spying upon all these fields of cows. .. Do you think agents do not take holidays?"" A: "".. there's no way to tell whether you're lying."" J: ""What use would I be to my country if any passing British Service agent could tell I was lying? I will admit it puts me at a disadvantage when I happen to be telling the truth."" A: ""Fortunately, that doesn't happen often."" The first night she offers tea and comfort p111. J: ""It is my wish to spend the night with you, in your bed."" A: ""It is a dull day that doesn't bring some surprise."" J: ""You are said to be a young steed in bed. I stayed in an inn in Milan run by two widows."" A: ""I offered to marry them both, but they didn't take me up on it."" A minor English diplomat falls to his death, clutching several hairs of his killer, for overheard words ""La dame, le fou, la tour"" and an imminent date. They must solve this riddle to save Napoleon, but the ensuing bullet drives them apart until 1818. Another puzzle asks what mastermind plants Hawker-initialled knives into (former?) French spies in London? ( The only possible mastermind gets the best possible end, well-deserved. Sneaky political Military Intelligence rival bought Cache Jane Cardiff at 11, abused and enslaved her will. Our heroes find, decode, and use appropriately her journal.

Keeping ""on"" hints undressed only on island, maybe modest elsewhere. If ""He could have been a savage who had never been clothed, from one of the far islands of the world"", even with comma, clothes may originate from island. Amusing to imagine giant sizes hat, shirt, pants, or dress? suitably distributed on stony outcrops or vegetation, gloves wave on palm trees? boots protrude from underwater reef?

Surely every character need not repeat the same silly compliment? ), and really laughed out loud everytime that occurred (more than once!). But, I still think the author did a fair enough job. My main quibble is,  she's managed to not drag any OW into the main story in any of her previous books. And for the main villain/associate to be the OW is a cliche that's been overused in romance mysteries. I never expected JAK to take that route.

209,"I liked this one better while I was reading it than after I was finished, if that makes sense. While I was reading, the pacing was brisk and the writing humorous and interesting, and there was still some hope that some of the logical inconsistencies might be explained. I mean, the character-training-to-impersonate-a-noble trope is fairly well-worn territory in fiction. In most versions, though, the character is taking the place of a person that either no one else has met before, or hasn't seen for years and years. In this story, however, we have a girl taking the place of another girl in a high-ranking, public position, interacting with people who last saw the girl she is replacing a few MONTHS ago. How, exactly, is that supposed to work? They look superficially alike in hair and eye color, and they seem to rely on the fact that the original was supposedly sick and our new girl is thinner and people attribute some of the difference to that, but...really? A person who has lost a few pounds in a few months doesn't look like a totally different person. What's more, do none of her close friends and associates know her voice? Her mannerisms? Her interests? After reading it, I was left with the fact that, although some people had figured this out, a lot hadn't, and this wasn't going to be addressed. Not only that, one of the people who had figured it out immediately, the princess on whom Peggy is waiting, was apparently going to take her back on as a Lady-In-Waiting, but as herself. Perhaps I read wrong and she is keeping up the facade of this other character, but it didn't read that way. How would that work? ""Here's this girl who we've been passing off as your old friend, but she's not, she's this other girl. We're sure she'll remain a great spy, because why wouldn't all of you trust a person like that with your treasonous secrets?""

I also liked that the first one had more of the band in it. Which is the best part of any Robin Hood story. Also Scarlet's stubbornness, and actions started to annoy me at times. I also found some stuff unnecessary Like really did they need to cut off her fingers? and where did this sudden PTSD come from? If he had it, wouldn't it have been noticeable in the first one as well? I did love that there was more of Scarlet and Rob's love story, because I was really upset they didn't even kiss by the end of the last one.

How could they kill off John? Especially before him and Rob could fully make up! I was even a little saddened by Guy's death. The book made me feel sorry for him in a way.

Dorrie considers them to be close but it is quite unexpected when Isabelle asks her if she can drive her to a funeral in Ohio - tomorrow. Dorrie is having problems of her own with her family and decides that a few days away might be good for everyone. Once on the road Isabelle shocks Dorrie by starting to tell a story about her romantic relationship with a black man in Kentucky in 1939. I listened to this on audio (partially during a road trip through Kentucky) and it was very well done. There were two narrators; one for each character. The production was great. That being said - For the love of all that is holy, don't listen to this book on audio! Seriously, you'll thank me for that advice. Here's the problem. If I had been reading this book I probably wouldn't have put it down. It would have been a page turner for me. But when you listen to it on audio you can't go any faster. It is going to take 13 hours no matter how much you want to know what happens. The book is suspenseful. You know any book talking about a relationship between a white woman and a black man in Kentucky in 1939 isn't going to be all sunshine and roses. I found myself saying ""Oh, this is bad"" a lot. I also found myself driving through Kentucky yelling into my voice search on my phone trying to find out how this books ends. I was still going to listen to it anyway but I wanted to know a few things because my nerves were about shot. There are no spoilers for this on the internet that I found. I've very annoyed about that. Sometimes you need spoilers for your own peace of mind so I'm putting a minor one here. If you are looking for spoilers in a panic because you need to know if it is going to be slightly ok before your next stop - you're welcome. Robert does not get murdered because of his relationship with Isabelle. I liked Dorrie and her story. I liked her reactions to thinking that she was doing a favor for a nice old lady and suddenly finding herself swept up in this secret from Isabelle's past. I wouldn't have been as patient as this character was in finding out what happened. (See ""yelling into voice search in Kentucky""). I found the young Isabelle to be very naive and because of that she was annoying at times. A lot of what happened might have been lessened had she made more of an effort to stand up for herself instead of passively going along once things got rough. Overall it is a sad book because of the damage that was done to everyone involved with Isabelle because of the tension between black and whites in Kentucky.

Over the ensuing decade or so, I had heard on and off how great this book was. So I was a little disappointed upon reading it. First of all, it's not really about Galileo's Daughter which was rather disappointing. Maybe I should've known better, should've realized that it's really a biography of Galileo, but I didn't. So here I am for the first part of the book waiting for all the interesting things about Galileo's daughter and nun life and all that. Except it never really delivered. I mean, as a biography of Galileo it's good I suppose though there were times I felt like the author assumed I knew more about the scientist than I actually did. But it was disappointing to me because the letters from Souer Maria Celeste and the explanations of some things behind her letters and her life in the convent were the most interesting parts to me, but they weren't delved into with any depth. And then you get to the end and it feels a little rushed. Maria Celeste dies abruptly, followed shortly by Galileo and it's like ""oh, ok."" So if you know some things about Galileo and want to get a little more into his life then by all means, read this book.

214,"I devoured this book. Sophia has come to Russia to claim the Russian throne and Prince Peter's heart. But what happens when Sophia finds that Peter is not who he seems? What happens when Sophia finds herself falling for someone else, a doomed romance? I'm so glad I was given the opportunity to read this. It was simply amazing. There are no other words to describe this. Everything fell into place to create this awesome story of Catherine the Great. I loved Sophia's story. It was so interesting to learn about her life, past and present. The Russian court was simply amazing as well. I've always loved books with a Russian theme, so I couldn't put this book down. Sophia herself was an amazing main character. She's so strong. She's smart and cunning. She's caring. And, yes, she knows that men think of her as a possession-something to own. But does she ever bend and break to it? No. She outsmarts them all. I found my heart breaking for her many times. I also found myself rooting for her. She deserves happiness and real love. She is definitely one of the best MC's I've read in a while. She really stayed true to the real Catherine the Great. Her character was very historically accurate as far as her personality goes. The royal court side to things was also very interesting. It reminded me of a soap opera with all of the drama that was going on. I know that there was always scandal in royal courts, but jeez. Anyways, I liked it. It kept things interesting when things were starting to get a little bland. The steps to becoming a suitable bride was also really cool to read about. The romance.. wow. I feel like I should hose myself down with cold water after reading this book. The romance was so intense. I could practically feel the passion seeping out of this book. And it was even a gradual love (yay). There is a love triangle in this book... or more of a love square if you want to call it that. There are three possible love interests in this book.

Ugh, he was so mysterious and brooding. And Serg... he was so kind and compassionate. However, I am content on who she ""picks"" at the end, although it was sort of bittersweet. UGH.

215,"What a strange book. I bought this back in 2007 or so and quickly gave up on it because it was so BORING. At times, when action occurred, this book was great. The travel sections were beautifully written, and I nearly missed my stop on the train twice because I was so engrossed. Sadly these exciting travel sections were interspersed with dull historical background - I could probably have skipped those bits and not lost anything. It was all too easy during those dull sections to become distracted and spend twenty minutes staring at the photo of the author on the back cover and wondering what the story was there - why is she wearing her Queen Victoria cosplay? One question which I had at the end. Does the plot actually make sense? Why was Dracula giving the books out to historians, only to dissuade them from continuing their hunt for him once they'd become interested? If all he's ever wanted is someone to catalogue his book collection, surely this is the most ineffectual recruitment method in existence? Actually, one further question: why do we never know the daughters name? Ten years later, and I am glad that I've finally ploughed through it, partly because that means I can remove it from my home. I'm going to give it to my mum, because she reads really quickly and doesn't seem to take much in, so she should quite like it.",2,history,"['strange', 'book', 'buy', 'quickly', 'give', 'boring', 'time', 'action', 'occur', 'book', 'great', 'travel', 'section', 'beautifully', 'write', 'nearly', 'miss', 'stop', 'train', 'twice', 'engrossed', 'sadly', 'exciting', 'travel', 'section', 'intersperse', 'dull', 'historical', 'background', 'probably', 'skip', 'bit', 'lose', 'easy', 'dull', 'section', 'distracted', 'spend', 'minute', 'stare', 'photo', 'author', 'cover', 'wonder', 'story', 'wear', 'queen', 'victoria', 'cosplay', 'question', 'end', 'plot', 'actually', 'sense', 'dracula', 'give', 'book', 'historian', 'dissuade', 'continue', 'hunt', 'interested', 'want', 'catalogue', 'book', 'collection', 'surely', 'ineffectual', 'recruitment', 'method', 'existence', 'actually', 'question', 'know', 'daughters', 'year_later', 'glad', 'finally', 'plough', 'partly', 'mean', 'remove', 'home', 'go', 'mum', 'read', 'quickly', 'like']"
216,"I enjoyed The Good Earth, particularly the first half. The story did not go where I thought it would and from about the time that Wang Lung takes a concubine  to the end I was feeling frustrated, but in the end I think I started to appreciate what Buck was doing, and the story, which had gotten too big, in my opinion, got even a bit bigger, and that saved it for me. (I really don't know what the hell I'm talking about and clearly I need to think a more about this book. Apparently, it is the first in a trilogy, but I'm hoping it's more a thematic trilogy as there were no characters I wanted to read more about left alive by the end. ) The prose is deceptively simple. I found myself riveted by the details of daily life and work and land and less so by the parts of the story that dealt with internecine relationships. I've been having a hard time deciding if being irritated with the main character throughout much of the book is a testament to Buck's writing or not, but I think probably it is. By far, my favorite character is O-lan and  I really missed her when she was gone; for me she was the moral center and heart of the story. I listened to the audiobook read by Anthony Heald, who did a fantastic job. I was even wondering if perhaps the book would have been harder for me to get through during the second half if I had been reading a paper book. I might have gotten sick of another bad, selfish, stupid decision made by Wang Lung   and given up. It was the perfect book for the summer, too, and it reminded me of a summer a few years ago when I was listened to the entire Laura Ingalls Wilder series while I was working on a labor intensive quilt I was putting together for a friend. The work was long and monotonous, but compared to what the characters were struggling with, it was nothing. The Good Earth, as Buck would perhaps write, was ""such an one.""",3,history,"['enjoy', 'good', 'earth', 'particularly', 'half', 'story', 'think', 'time', 'wang', 'lung', 'take', 'concubine', 'end', 'feel', 'frustrated', 'end', 'think', 'start', 'appreciate', 'buck', 'story', 'get', 'big', 'opinion', 'get', 'bit', 'big', 'save', 'know', 'hell', 'talk', 'clearly', 'need', 'think', 'book', 'apparently', 'trilogy', 'hope', 'thematic', 'trilogy', 'character', 'want', 'read', 'leave', 'alive', 'end', 'prose', 'deceptively', 'simple', 'find', 'rivet', 'detail', 'daily', 'life', 'work', 'land', 'part', 'story', 'deal', 'internecine', 'relationship', 'have', 'hard', 'time', 'decide', 'irritate', 'main_character', 'book', 'testament', 'buck', 'writing', 'think', 'probably', 'far', 'favorite', 'character', 'o', 'lan', 'miss', 'go', 'moral', 'center', 'heart', 'story', 'listen_audiobook', 'read', 'anthony', 'heald', 'fantastic_job', 'wonder', 'book', 'hard', 'second_half', 'read', 'paper', 'book', 'get', 'sick', 'bad', 'selfish', 'stupid', 'decision', 'wang', 'lung', 'give', 'perfect', 'book', 'summer', 'remind', 'summer', 'year_ago', 'listen', 'entire', 'laura', 'ingalls', 'wilder', 'series', 'work', 'labor', 'intensive', 'quilt', 'put', 'friend', 'work', 'long', 'monotonous', 'compare', 'character', 'struggle', 'good', 'earth', 'buck', 'write']"

218,"I don't read many m/f romances these days, but the blurb on this one caught my attention. I love the concept of a caveman and a modern woman. Fortunately, the book did not turn out to just be a great idea with mediocre execution. I enjoyed the story and felt the deep love of the two MCs, though at times it was difficult to figure out exactly what was going on with the 'future' woman. I was of two minds about whether or not we really should have seen more of the female's POV. On the one hand, as I mentioned, sometimes things were just confusing without it because the caveman could not fathom what was going on so his descriptions were not very helpful. For example, the description of the device the father arrived on and later the 'black rectangle' that she kept items in. What was it? The fact that it was so 'magical' made it seem like she was from a time far beyond our own. . On the other hand, there was value in the reader staying as confused as the caveman in the story and being fully in his head. I'm not sure if a modern girl would really choose to stay in a world without TV, shopping malls, cell phones, and, like, people to talk to. But Ehd was very sweet and I was willing to roll with it. Very unusual and romantic.

219,"My gut reaction upon finishing this was to give it five stars, but I might have to bump it down to four, for lack of character development. Also the ending is kind of blah...I remember having that same issue with Between Shades of Gray as well. It sort of lacks the emotional punch of all that comes before it. Plus, I wanted Joana to find out  that Lina was still alive and also conveniently married her love interest! I'm not sure why I have such a strong reaction against either of these relationships. After all, the only thing that makes me marginally less sad when I think about The Book Thief is my fantasy epilogue in which Liesel and Max get married. And I squeed when Rose Under Fire confirmed that Maddie and Jamie DID get married after the end of Code Name Verity. But Joana and Florian? Wasn't feeling it. I think it comes back to that lack of character development. There are four different narrators here: the aforementioned Florian and Joana, a soldier with a secret and a nurse, respectively. Then there's Emilia, a Polish girl on the run after the Russians attacked Nemmersdorf, and sailor Alfred, who has an over-inflated sense of self importance. I figured his stupid ass would be the only one to survive, and I found his death morbidly satisfying. You kick some xenophobic ass, Emilia! Emilia latches onto Florian when he rescues her from a Russian soldier and they quickly meet up with Joana and a group of refugees, include a shoemaker, a lost boy, and Eva, who's a filter-less pessimist. Alfred is aboard the Wilhelm Gustloff, which is where the other 3 are headed, trying to escape the Allies' inevitable invasion of Poland and East Prussia. It's interesting to see the war from the Axis side. In this case, the Allies are the enemies (to be fair, it seems to mostly be Russians, and I've never been clear what side they ended up on, truly). Also, did you know that the sinking of the Wilhelm Gustloff was the greatest maritime tragedy, worse than Titanic or Lusitania? Because I sure didn't! Seriously didn't know this boat existed until I heard about this book. And Sepetys doesn't really have much of an explanation for WHY. I suspect it's the same reason no one knew about what happened in the Baltic nations until decades later. I mean...there were 10,000 people on that boat! It was built for only around 1500, and ten of the lifeboats weren't even on board. Only a thousand people survived. It's horrific and yet no one has heard of it. It's certainly an emotionally gripping story, and the chapters are all very short, so it moves quickly. But I feel like the horror of the situation is doing a lot of the emotional heavy lifting. It's gut-wrenching to read about what the refugees in that harbor experienced before even getting on the doomed boat, and once the Wilhelm Gustloff states sinking, it only gets...gut-wrenchinger. I'm horrified and emotionally affected because the situation itself is horrifying (so many babies getting thrown and not being caught), not because I'm emotionally connected to the characters (Unless you count a strong desire to punch Alfred). I will say that all four narrators do feel distinct. I had very little trouble telling them apart, but for some reason I just didn't feel that connection. This is still a great, fast read, and I am definitely planning to add it to my shelf for my next round of World War II novels.",4,history,"['gut', 'reaction', 'finish', 'star', 'bump', 'lack', 'character_development', 'ending', 'kind', 'blah', 'remember', 'have', 'issue', 'shades', 'gray', 'sort', 'lack_emotional', 'punch', 'come', 'plus', 'want', 'joana', 'find', 'lina', 'alive', 'conveniently', 'marry', 'love_interest', 'sure', 'strong', 'reaction', 'relationship', 'thing', 'make', 'marginally', 'sad', 'think', 'book', 'thief', 'fantasy', 'epilogue', 'liesel', 'max', 'marry', 'squee', 'rose', 'fire', 'confirm', 'maddie', 'jamie', 'marry', 'end', 'code_verity', 'joana', 'florian', 'feel', 'think', 'come', 'lack', 'character_development', 'different', 'narrator', 'aforementioned', 'florian', 'joana', 'soldier', 'secret', 'nurse', 'respectively', 'emilia', 'polish', 'girl', 'run', 'russians', 'attack', 'nemmersdorf', 'sailor', 'alfred', 'inflate', 'sense', 'self', 'importance', 'figure', 'stupid', 'ass', 'survive', 'find', 'death', 'morbidly', 'satisfying', 'kick', 'xenophobic', 'ass', 'emilia', 'emilia', 'latch', 'florian', 'rescue', 'russian', 'soldier', 'quickly', 'meet', 'joana', 'group', 'refugee', 'include', 'shoemaker', 'lost', 'boy', 'eva', 'filter', 'pessimist', 'alfred', 'aboard', 'wilhelm_gustloff', 'head', 'try', 'escape', 'allies', 'inevitable', 'invasion', 'poland', 'east', 'prussia', 'interesting', 'war', 'axis', 'case', 'allies', 'enemy', 'fair', 'russians', 'clear', 'end', 'truly', 'know', 'sinking', 'wilhelm_gustloff', 'great', 'maritime', 'tragedy', 'bad', 'titanic', 'lusitania', 'sure', 'seriously', 'know', 'boat', 'exist', 'hear', 'book', 'sepetys', 'explanation', 'suspect', 'reason', 'know', 'happen', 'baltic', 'nation', 'decade', 'later', 'mean', 'people', 'boat', 'build', 'lifeboat', 'board', 'thousand', 'people', 'survive', 'horrific', 'hear', 'certainly', 'emotionally', 'gripping', 'story', 'chapter', 'short', 'move', 'quickly', 'feel', 'like', 'horror', 'situation', 'lot', 'emotional', 'heavy', 'lifting', 'gut', 'wrench', 'read', 'refugee', 'harbor', 'experience', 'get', 'doom', 'boat', 'wilhelm_gustloff', 'state', 'sink', 'get', 'gut', 'wrenchinger', 'horrified', 'emotionally', 'affect', 'situation', 'horrifying', 'baby', 'getting', 'throw', 'catch', 'emotionally', 'connected', 'character', 'count', 'strong', 'desire', 'punch', 'alfred', 'narrator', 'feel', 'distinct', 'little', 'trouble', 'tell', 'apart', 'reason', 'feel', 'connection', 'great', 'fast', 'read', 'definitely', 'plan', 'add', 'shelf', 'round', 'world_war', 'ii', 'novel']"
220,"Since I adored Code Name Verity, I pre-ordered this book almost immediately after I learned of its existence. It's sort of a companion to Verity, in that it takes place (at first) with the ATA female pilots (and we get to see Maddie again and she's still a badass), but really you could read one without having read the other. I feel like I appreciate some of the early plot points more, having read Verity (Maddie and Jamie get married and live in a castle! Now I just need Marcus Zuzak to write some kind of Book Thief companion wherein we learn that Liesel and Max also got married and lived in a castle and my life will be complete! Anyway. This time our protagonist is Rose Justice, an American pilot working for the ATA in Britain, with our favorite badass lady pilot Maddie. Time-wise, it takes place after all of the events of Verity, and while Maddie talks a little about Julie, Wein is able to refer to the story without giving away too many of the major plot points. I like that it's sort of a sequel in that we get to catch up with Maddie (and she gets the happy ending she so sorely deserves), but it's clearly Rose's story. Rose's father trained her to fly from a very young age, so she's a skilled pilot even though she's only 18 years old. On a routine transport to Paris, Rose is captured by the Germans when she makes the mistake of trying to knock a doodlebug (a pilotless bomb) out of the air. She's more or less successful in that particular endeavor, but in tailing the doodlebug, she becomes lost and eventually runs out of fuel. Since she's American, in a British plane, in German territory, officials naturally suspect the worst and it isn't long until Rose is transported to Ravensbruck, a concentration camp primarily for political prisoners. Oddly enough, this is what I had assumed would be the plot of Verity (I still have no idea where I got that particular notion), so it was incredibly compelling to see it laid out here. Wein frames the story of Rose's time in the camp in the form of a journal, which she writes after her return to Paris, safe and (mostly) sound. It's a really interesting framing device, in that Rose is a bit scattered at first -- she's safe, but she doesn't remember what it's like to be safe, and she's having a hard time dealing with some pretty crippling feelings of guilt. It's a fascinating exploration. Most of the novels or survivors accounts I'm familiar with deal with the time in the camp, but not with what happened after people returned to the world. And Rose is faced with a world that doesn't want to believe her stories. I think there was quite a bit of denial at the time -- no one wants to think that humans are truly capable of committing such atrocities against one another. It's far easier to believe the survivors invented their stories than that their captors actually did such things. Wein shows Rose wrestling with all of those emotions -- what does she say to her family? How can she put on a happy face for her mother and her aunt when all she can think about are the women she left behind, and the ones who were never able to escape? Rose spends around two weeks in Paris, writing fiendishly to get all of it down --the writing seems to have a calming effect. She's been tasked to tell the world what happened in Ravensbruck, but she can't seem to actually talk about it. Writing it down sort of frees her from having to tell anyone, but provides a record nonetheless. I like that throughout, Wein has Rose frequently reference the fact that she's writing a story (she knowingly leaves out details that are too hard to recall, or too boring, and she's honest when she legitimately does not remember something). Upon arriving at camp, Rose is savagely beaten by the guards, and tossed into what basically amounts to solitary confinement for a week. She manages to make friends with the French girls in her transport, and one -- Elodie -- remains her connection within the camp, even though the two never see one another after their initial two weeks together. After leaving confinement, Rose ends up in Bunk 32 with the group of women known as Rabbits. Though Rose is not a real person, the Rabbits and the experiments performed on them are horrifyingly real -- Wein apparently used survivor accounts and testimonies to peice together the Rabbits' stories (and she uses many of their real names). Much like Mengel at Auschwitz, the doctors at Ravensbruck performed horrific experiments on a small group of women who came to be known as Rabbits. Most of the ""experiments"" involve simulating various leg injuries, ostensibly to help the troops injured in combat. Wein spares almost no detail in describing these injuries, and the women in the camp are fiercely protective of all of the Rabbits -- it is their story and their wounds that will finally tell the world the truth of what happened in Ravensbruck. The lengths to which people will go to protect them are incredible -- at one point, a group of women spend an entire week underneath the tile in the bathroom, after their numbers are called for the gas chambers. I cannot even begin to wrap my brain around that level of desperation, and Wein has such skill in describing it. Though I liked Rose well enough as a character, the supporting cast make the story here. Rose finds a family of sorts within Ravensbruck, and the relationships between all of the women feel both real and gut-wrenching. They latch onto Rose's poetry (both her own and the poems of Edna St Vincent Millay, which she has memorized), and Rose's own poetry is scattered throughout. Someone of these poems are poignant, and some are a little overwrought, but the importance of poetry to the women is incredibly clear. Rose makes up a counting rhyme to remember the names of the 74 women who were Rabbits, and it is this poem that is the basis for the drive to ""tell the world."" Her other poems she must craft and then memorize and pass along to the others, without the aid of paper. It's almost heartbreaking to see her reaction in Paris, when faced with her original journal -- a little like Ren in The Year of the Flood, who spent her childhood memorizing lessons and finds writing eerily permanent, Rose struggles initially with the permanence of her words on the paper. Writing the story is like re-living it. The ending was a little unbelievable, but given that we know she gets to Paris somehow the fact that Rose breaks out of a camp is necessarily a surprise (I had assumed she was part of a group who were liberated). I find it hard to believe that three half-starved women were able to clandestinely steal a plane, but I suppose you can chalk it up to the fact that, by that point in the war, the camps weren't being run with the same sort of organization (I feel like in...Night, maybe, it's mentioned that once the Germans knew they'd lost the war, the guards basically just abandoned the camps and left the prisoners to fend for themselves? Am I making that up? ), so no one was around to notice. And given that both Rose and Irina are actual trained pilots, I have no trouble believing that, once they were on board, they were able to fly the plane (unlike the freaking hot air balloon escape at the end of The Dark & Hollow Places). Teaching a Holocaust unit every other year, and having read several Holocaust novels in my life, I had reached a point of...not fatigue, exactly, but a sinking feeling that there wasn't much new to be said. I remember after reading The Twelve, I thought Sarah's experiences sort of mirrored a Holocaust novel, and felt like a lot of the others I'd read were starting to blend together. I'd worried that there was only so much to write about, and that the stories would start to lose their poignancy. Wein renewed my faith in this particular subgenre, and really in historical fiction as a whole. There is indeed, a way to write history without it feeling like a history textbook. Wein is even able to weave in details about flying and air combat without dragging down the narrative. As I said, I like that Wein focused not just on life inside the camps, but on what happened to survivors back in the ""real world."" I wish more Holocaust novels took this track. In all, this novel has pretty much cemented me as a Wein fan -- as long as she doesn't jump on the paranormal romance trilogy bandwagon, I will read pretty much anything this woman writes. Hopefully she continues her quest to give historical fiction a better name. I'd love to see what she'd do with the roaring twenties...",4,history,"['adore', 'code_verity', 'pre_order', 'book', 'immediately', 'learn', 'existence', 'sort', 'companion', 'verity', 'take_place',

221,"Read This Review And More Like It On My Blog! This was very, very good. I was surprised by the level of my reaction to this: I was invested near immediately never wanted to put it down and was sad to finish reading the last page. I don't read a lot of ""time slip"" historical fiction (read: any before this), but if they're like Mariana that rule might need to change. ASAP. First up on that list: every other such book by this author. I was very impressed with both parts of the narrative and the strength of the voice shown throughout the novel. Though Mariana is a bit lengthy at near 375 pages, this suspenseful and affecting tale never bores. For a detailed, immersive read but not one that is exactly an action-packed historical, that is saying something indeed. The strength of the book largely lies in the eponymous character Mariana - both in her 1660's body/life of Mariana and as more modern Julia Beckett. That's not to say that the rest of the characters aren't interesting and diverse; they are but it is Mariana herself who makes the novel special. Though the two POV's present are both first-person and both largely the same in tone and voice despite the centuries between them, both Julia and Mariana are fully dimensional, rounded characters who provide a rich, full narrative to dive into. She's charming and detailed as a narrator: Exbury, both past and present versions, definitely carried the feel of an old, full-of-history English village. Though there is quite a lot of focus on the romance angle of the novel, I wasn't turned off or frustrated; Mariana's and Richard's courtship is actually quite charming and I found myself rooting for de Mornay and the spirited commoner. This paragraph might get a bit SPOILERy so be warned and stay away if you don't want to know! Seriously, people. There's a mystery at the heart of the novel, but it's not the most involving or mystifying. Even the secondary subplot of treason lacks the emotional pull of the characters themselves; this is truly a character-driven novel. Even some of the surprises lacked the oomph that could be expected -(Johnnie! D: John?!) because I was so keyed in on the main characters of Mariana/Julia and Richard/?? themselves. I have to side with Julia in that the past has a lot of allure here in this version, and her attraction to Richard going back to it is very understandable. Love, destiny and fate all play a key parts in the meanderig plot, and the characters but it doesn't feel forced or hackneyed. Mariana comes off with a sweet but not saccharine aftertaste. I did think the camouflaging of Richard's soul was well done - only the hints of Shakespeare really made me sure of who he was in the present . Mariana is an engrossing and rewarding, lengthy read - fans of time-slip historicals will love and even new-to-the-subgrenre people will find a lot to enjoy about this alternate 1660's and modern of reincarnated love. Susanna Kearsley is an impressive and detailed storyteller - I look forward to reading more of her books very soon. This is one that went above and beyond any and all expectations I had before starting.",4,history,"['read', 'review', 'like', 'blog', 'good', 'surprise', 'level', 'reaction', 'invested', 'near', 'immediately', 'want', 'sad', 'finish', 'read', 'page', 'read', 'lot', 'time', 'slip', 'historical_fiction', 'read', 'like', 'mariana', 'rule', 'need', 'change', 'asap', 'list', 'book', 'author', 'impressed', 'part', 'narrative', 'strength', 'voice', 'show', 'novel', 'mariana', 'bit', 'lengthy', 'near', 'page', 'suspenseful', 'affecting', 'tale', 'bore', 'detailed', 'immersive', 'read', 'exactly', 'action', 'pack', 'historical', 'say', 'strength', 'book', 'largely', 'lie', 'eponymous', 'character', 'mariana', 'body', 'life', 'mariana', 'modern', 'julia', 'beckett', 'rest', 'character', 'interesting', 'diverse', 'mariana', 'make', 'novel', 'special', 'pov', 'present', 'person', 'largely', 'tone', 'voice', 'despite', 'century', 'julia', 'mariana', 'fully', 'dimensional', 'rounded', 'character', 'provide', 'rich', 'narrative', 'dive', 'charming', 'detailed', 'narrator', 'exbury', 'past_present', 'version', 'definitely', 'carry', 'feel', 'old', 'history', 'english', 'village', 'lot', 'focus', 'romance', 'angle', 'novel', 'turn', 'frustrate', 'mariana', 'richard', 'courtship', 'actually', 'charming', 'find', 'root', 'de', 'mornay', 'spirited', 'commoner', 'paragraph', 'bit', 'spoilery', 'warn', 'stay', 'away', 'want', 'know', 'seriously', 'people', 'mystery', 'heart', 'novel', 'involving', 'mystifying', 'secondary', 'subplot', 'treason', 'lack_emotional', 'pull', 'character', 'truly', 'character', 'drive', 'novel', 'surprise', 'lack', 'oomph', 'expect', 'd', 'john', 'key', 'main_character', 'mariana', 'julia', 'julia', 'past', 'lot', 'allure', 'version', 'attraction', 'richard', 'go', 'understandable', 'love', 'destiny', 'fate', 'play', 'key', 'part', 'meanderig', 'plot', 'character', 'feel_forced', 'hackneyed', 'mariana', 'come', 'sweet', 'saccharine', 'aftertaste', 'think', 'camouflaging', 'richard', 'soul', 'hint', 'shakespeare', 'sure', 'present', 'mariana', 'engrossing', 'rewarding', 'lengthy', 'read', 'fan', 'time', 'slip', 'historical', 'love', 'new', 'subgrenre', 'people', 'find', 'lot', 'enjoy', 'alternate', 'modern', 'reincarnate', 'love', 'susanna', 'kearsley', 'impressive', 'detailed', 'storyteller', 'look_forward', 'read', 'book', 'soon', 'go', 'expectation', 'start']"
222,"If I only had one word to use for this awesomely delicious adventure, it would be 'revelatory'. I've caught myself surprised numerous times in my reading, which, needless to say, is thoroughly wonderful and satisfying. I was already more than halfway in lustlove with Colin and I already held Minerva dear, dear to my heart in ANTS, but AWTBW elevated that love for them to new heights. Er, not spoilers really, but under the cut for now nonetheless. Seeing these two lose their equilibrium as they discover and explore the truths uncovered about each other made my heart ache. We are treated to see beyond the facade, and suddenly I was seeing the imperfections and/or insecurities they attempt to amend, and there they were, authentic and heartrendingly real. I love Colin for all his good intentions and fierce protectiveness and genuine affection for M, and I love Minerva for her bravery and fierce loyalty and for allowing herself to live her life for herself. Oh, these two. They may have seemed to be an unlikely pair in the beginning, but discerning minds know it is no coincidence that these two people gravitated towards each other; theirs is a cleverly matched alliance formed in the beginning, turned to a deeply loving allegiance that can't be shaken in the end. I'm so glad to partake in this grand adventure to see two genuinely beautiful people flourish and shine, as individuals and as partners. A Week To Be Wicked is the second book in the Spindle Cove series, and it will be out on March 27, 2012. I've already pre-ordered my copy, but I've been very fortunate to have been given early access to the book via Edelweiss. The third, A Lady by Midnight, will be out this September.

223,"I usually adore books by Joanna Chambers, they are the rare one that makes me emotional. This one had all ingridients for the needed catharsis, but unfortunately there was one moment that spoiled the ending of the book for me. After the big relevation talk in the inn in Truro there was no closure between Nick and Ward. The break-off was too fundamental for them to return to their happy-end relationship after Godfrey's death without aknowledging it somehow in the last chapters. I didn't believe in HEA, not for strong willed Nick and Ward who is obviously bad with social interactions. I wouldn't have asked so much from any author, but Joanna Chambers spoilt me with her flawless human studies in Enlightenment series, so now I expect only perfection from her.",3,history,"['usually', 'adore', 'book', 'joanna', 'chambers', 'rare', 'make', 'emotional', 'ingridient', 'need', 'catharsis', 'unfortunately', 'moment', 'spoil', 'ending', 'book', 'big', 'relevation', 'talk', 'inn', 'truro', 'closure', 'nick', 'ward', 'break', 'fundamental', 'return', 'happy', 'end', 'relationship', 'godfrey', 'death', 'aknowledge', 'chapter', 'believe', 'hea', 'strong_willed', 'nick', 'ward', 'obviously', 'bad', 'social', 'interaction', 'ask', 'author', 'joanna', 'chambers', 'spoil', 'flawless', 'human', 'study', 'enlightenment', 'series', 'expect', 'perfection']"
224,"First and foremost, trigger warnings should be mentioned and noted before reading this book/this review. TW: drug abuse, self-harm, suicide, anxiety. I don't know, y'all. I decided to sit on this review and think about it but in doing so, I've nearly forgotten about the whole thing because it was just so awful to me. I think I've pretty much blocked it out of my brain. I want to erase it. Okay, so I will tell you some things about it. I'll mark spoilers below. The book starts out with our protagonist, Audrey, who is in high school. Audrey has a panic attack one day and decides to tell a DISGUSTING lie about a classmate to her two best friends. What they don't know is that one of her friend's sister is outside of the door and decides to tell their mom who tells someone else who tells someone else and becomes a full-blown gossip story. Which everyone immediately accepts as absolute truth. The lie ends up being the downfall of this classmate. So, Audrey has to live with the fact that her lie caused so much tragedy and altered the lives of people she both knows and doesn't know. I don't know... sounds a little familiar to 13 Reasons Why, doesn't it? It's not the same but similar. And I haven't read 13 Reasons Why and I won't because of the very problematic aspects. Well, I see the same problematic aspects here. I just need to rant about the lie for a minute because it deeply upset me and set the tone for the rest of the book. MAJOR SPOILERS: Audrey, without blinking an eye, or without taking it back immediately, tells her two best friends that she saw her classmate Ana having sex with her own father. As in incest. Do you see what I mean by utterly disgusting now? I do NOT like this as a plot point and it made me very uncomfortable. It made me even more uncomfortable that the novel tries to right the wrongs of Audrey and turn her into somewhat likable when the basis of this plot is that she made up such a revolting lie that caused the death of Ana. AND ANA IS MADE TO BE THE ONE TO BLAME IN THIS SITUATION SOMEHOW. AND THEN, to top it all off, Audrey pursues a romantic relationship with Ana's boyfriend... who she meets at Ana's funeral. And goes on pretending that everything is jolly and this relationship is healthy. How could I ever root this on in any form? AND AUDREY HAS A BOYFRIEND ALREADY. Who she has been close with since birth pretty much. She is not a nice human! And the entire ""romance"" is not what love is or should be. And I do NOT think this should be considered a romance book. It's a book about a terrible girl who told a terrible lie. And the ending... dear Lord, it was awful. Just plain awful. I could go into an entire new rant on that alone. It was TERRIBLE. Look, I know that some books are morally grey (I just wrote a review about one that did it well! ), but this is something I couldn't get on board with. Every part of it made me feel disgusted. Besides the awful plot, two characters were used as absolute filler for drama (Candela) and to promote another relationship (Duck), and many of the other characters just fell flat and didn't feel real at all. Audrey's decisions made me really angry and her self-loathing over creating so much calamity also made me roll my eyes. Because YEAH WHO DOES THAT. Even with the panic attacks and anxiety (hello I've dealt with this all my life), I just couldn't relate. None of it felt very realistic. There's just no redeeming qualities to her. AT ALL. But I will say that the book ended very fittingly. Especially for such deeply unlikable characters. Wolves in sheep's clothing, like in the blurb. At least Leav seems to be aware of that fact. This book just wasn't my cup of tea. At all. I need something to root for. I don't think there are good messages in this book, and I don't really think it's appropriate (or healthy) for teenagers to read. I'm just looking out. I think a lot of what's written in here is super dangerous territory. I would hate for the ""lessons"" in this book to be taken to heart by young people.

225,"There was no logical reason why I chose Hamlet to be the next Shakespeare on my reading list, but I'm glad I did. Polonius irked me from the beginning in fact, I was cheering Hamlet on when he stabbed him. And how stupid he was for giving away his position in the first place! I think that Rosencrantz and Guildenstern reflect the snakes that enter everyone's life at some point: cowardly, selfish backstabbers. Poor Ophelia! I realize that Hamlet had other things on his mind, (like which family member to kill first) but couldn't he have at least admitted to his love for Ophelia before she was six feet under!? I wanted to slap everyone for trying to use her as a pawn. And I rather enjoyed her eerie songs while they lasted. Is it weird that my favorite scene was in Act V when Hamlet was playing with skulls and talking to the gravediggers? Up until Act IV, sc. vii, I would have rated it five stars  however, I docked a star because Shakespeare killed off Ophelia, but didn't kill off Laertes and Claudius soon enough. I liked this much more than Julius Caesar and Romeo & Juliet.",4,poetry,"['logical', 'reason', 'choose', 'hamlet', 'shakespeare', 'reading', 'list', 'glad', 'polonius', 'irk', 'beginning', 'fact', 'cheer', 'hamlet', 'stab', 'stupid', 'give', 'away', 'position', 'place', 'think', 'rosencrantz', 'guildenstern', 'reflect', 'snake', 'enter', 'life', 'point', 'cowardly', 'selfish', 'backstabber', 'poor', 'ophelia', 'realize', 'hamlet', 'thing', 'mind', 'like', 'family_member', 'kill', 'admit', 'love', 'ophelia', 'foot', 'want', 'slap', 'try', 'use', 'pawn', 'enjoy', 'eerie', 'song', 'last', 'weird', 'favorite', 'scene', 'act', 'v', 'hamlet', 'play', 'skull', 'talk', 'gravedigger', 'act', 'iv', 'sc', 'vii', 'rate', 'star', 'dock', 'star', 'shakespeare', 'kill', 'ophelia', 'kill', 'laertes', 'claudius', 'soon', 'like', 'julius', 'caesar', 'romeo_juliet']"
226,"Despite the three star review, this was one of the best works of poetry I've read in a long time. It might have resonated with me more if I had been actively grieving over something while reading it. But I enjoyed Porter's style, specifically his use of onomatopoeia and his mixture of verses and small paragraphs. From my understanding, I thought Crow was the embodiment of grief; he came uninvited, reminded the father and the children of the fact that their mother was gone, etc. But what I found a little disconcerting was the way that Crow (read: grief) became the protector of the family. He fought the demons at the front door, he felt sorry for the children, and towards the end became the father's companion. Sometimes, I felt as if I got the whole point wrong and maybe Crow was supposed to be symbolic of the father's work, considering that Crow left when the father's book was fully written. It is a beautiful thought--that even when you feel so alone, grief is always there with you. But I've always thought of grief as a dull, pulsating headache that you can't get rid of instead of a hand on the shoulder. And I think that's where Porter missed the mark. Then again, grief is different for everyone, and perhaps this is just one of its many manifestations. What I did glean from this book was that grief is something that comes uninvited, but you have to give it permission to leave. And if the point of a work of fiction is to make you think introspectively as well as abstractly, then this one has definitely fulfilled that purpose. I think it'll stay with me for a long time.",3,poetry,"['despite', 'star', 'review', 'good', 'work', 'poetry', 'read', 'long', 'time', 'resonate', 'actively', 'grieve', 'read', 'enjoy', 'porter', 'style', 'specifically', 'use', 'onomatopoeia', 'mixture', 'verse', 'small', 'paragraph', 'understanding', 'think', 'crow', 'embodiment', 'grief', 'come', 'uninvited', 'remind', 'father', 'child', 'fact', 'mother', 'go', 'etc', 'find', 'little', 'disconcerting', 'way', 'crow', 'read', 'grief', 'protector', 'family', 'fight', 'demon', 'door', 'feel', 'sorry', 'child', 'end', 'father', 'companion', 'feel', 'get', 'point', 'wrong', 'maybe', 'crow', 'suppose', 'symbolic', 'father', 'work', 'consider', 'crow', 'leave', 'father', 'book', 'fully', 'write', 'beautiful', 'thought', 'feel', 'grief', 'think', 'grief', 'dull', 'pulsate', 'headache', 'rid', 'instead', 'hand', 'shoulder', 'think', 'porter', 'miss', 'mark', 'grief', 'different', 'manifestation', 'glean', 'book', 'grief', 'come', 'uninvited', 'permission', 'leave', 'point', 'work', 'fiction', 'think', 'introspectively', 'abstractly', 'definitely', 'fulfil', 'purpose', 'think', 'stay', 'long', 'time']"
227,"This book started out so yellow that it turned me off for a while. But I think I ended up getting some of it. But I'm not sure yet. There's something about existence and the lingering effect of things, actions, occurrences. About longing and erosion. But I seemed to not care completely about any of this. The language made me keep a distance from what was being said. But some things inevitably remained. Specially how blue fucking can be. Some passages that I had to write down: Perhaps it is becoming clearer why I felt no romance when you told me that you carried my last letter with you, everywhere you went, for months on end, unopened. This may have served some purpose for you, but whatever it was, surely it bore little resemblance to mine. I never aimed to give you a talisman, an empty vessel to flood with whatever longing, dread, or sorrow happened to be the day's mood. I wrote it because I had something so say to you. ""We're only given as much as the heart can endure,"" ""What doest not kill you makes you stronger,"" ""Our sorrows provide us with the lessons we most need to learn"": these are the kinds of phrases that enrage my injured friend. Indeed, one would be hard-pressed to come up with a spiritual lesson that demands becoming a quadriparalytic. The tepid ""there must be a reason for it"" notion sometimes floated by religious or quasi-religious acquaintances or bystanders, is, to her, another form of violence. She has no time for it. She is too busy asking, in this changed form, what makes a livable life, and how she can live it. That the future is unknwoable is, for some, God's means of suturing us in, or to, the present moment. For others, it is the mark of a malevolence, a sure sign that out entire existence here is best understood as a sort of joke or mistake. For me, it is neither. It is simply the way that it is. Whether this accident be a happy or unhappy one is probably more a matter of mood than anything else; the difficulty is that ""our moods do not believe in each other"" (Emerson). One can wander about the landscape looking for clues, amassing evidence, but even the highest pile never seems to decide the case.",3,poetry,"['book', 'start', 'yellow', 'turn', 'think', 'end', 'get', 'sure', 'existence', 'linger', 'effect', 'thing', 'action', 'occurrence', 'longing', 'erosion', 'care', 'completely', 'language', 'distance', 'say', 'thing', 'inevitably', 'remain', 'specially', 'blue', 'fucking', 'passage', 'write', 'clear', 'feel', 'romance', 'tell', 'carry', 'letter', 'go', 'month', 'end', 'unopened', 'serve', 'purpose', 'surely', 'bear', 'little', 'resemblance', 'aim', 'talisman', 'vessel', 'flood', 'longing', 'dread', 'sorrow', 'happen', 'day', 'mood', 'write', 'give', 'heart', 'endure', 'doest', 'kill', 'make', 'strong', 'sorrow', 'provide', 'lesson', 'need', 'learn', 'kind', 'phrase', 'enrage', 'injure', 'friend', 'hard', 'press', 'come', 'spiritual', 'lesson', 'demand', 'quadriparalytic', 'tepid', 'reason', 'notion', 'float', 'religious', 'quasi', 'religious', 'acquaintance', 'bystander', 'form', 'violence', 'time', 'busy', 'ask', 'change', 'form', 'make', 'livable', 'life', 'live', 'future', 'unknwoable', 'god', 'mean', 'suture', 'present', 'moment', 'mark', 'malevolence', 'sure', 'sign', 'entire', 'existence', 'well', 'understand', 'sort', 'joke', 'mistake', 'simply', 'way', 'accident', 'happy', 'unhappy', 'probably', 'matter', 'mood', 'difficulty', 'mood', 'believe', 'emerson', 'wander', 'landscape', 'look', 'clue', 'amass', 'evidence', 'high', 'pile', 'decide', 'case']"
228,"My first brush with Blake was through the impeccable poem London more than a decade back. Since then, I'd got to read more poems of his, all carefully chosen by the academicians, quickly putting him in my list of favorite poets. Then before I reached my twenties, I read this little collection, and liked it immensely. Songs of Innocence was what I was looking for, with its naive outlook on life, the idyllic pictures of innocence I was unwilling to leave behind on my trek to youth. I was enamored (and still am) by the introductory piece: Piping down the valleys wild Piping songs of pleasant glee On a cloud I saw a child. And he laughing said to me. Pipe a song about a Lamb; So I piped with merry chear, Piper pipe that song again-- So I piped, he wept to hear. Drop thy pipe thy happy pipe Sing thy songs of happy chear, So I sung the same again While he wept with joy to hear. Piper sit thee down and write In a book that all may read-- So he vanish'd from my sight. And I pluck'd a hollow reed. And I made a rural pen, And I stain'd the water clear, And I wrote my happy songs Every child may joy to hear. To me, this was that drop of amnesiac honey that helped me get over the agony of the house-shifting we'd done that summer more than a decade ago, from a lush green safe township in the corner of the city to a closer-to-the-city, concrete-laden, greenery-starved, space-crunched area. It wasn't all that bad either, as I discovered later, but none of the former beauty of greeting the morning sun flanked by luxurious trees amidst the warbling of a dozen different birds remained. Suddenly, I was waking up to a harsh sun with no shady trees, and hardly any birds. Gone were the little gardens that every small home had. Now we had a larger home, with barely any space for even potted plants, let alone a garden. So yeah, poets like Wordsworth and Blake with their lyrical beauty and pastoral happy images and bleak city images were very much resonant with me. Now so many years later, while retaining my nostalgia for that magical place that had been my h(e)aven for many years, I am better capable of judging this collection from a newer perspective - one that has been shaped by reading many more poems since then, and has also gotten over the shift from innocence to experience, and values both equally. The first section of the collection, Songs of Innocence, now seems to me too simplistic with little exquisite craftsmanship that Wordsworth or Coleridge or even Browning still retains for me. They sound more like little elementary rhyming structures instead of that breath-taking exhilaration I want when I expect nostalgia to sweep over me. Only occasionally do I see those powerful streaks of thought, as in the little piece The Divine Image: And all must love the human form, In heathen, Turk, or Jew; Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell There God is dwelling too. Songs of Experience, however, fared better. There were glimmers of the pain that comes with experience, but also a sense of enlightenment that you wouldn't exchange for anything in the world, not even that former unblemished and profound innocence. But those bright powerful streaks ended soon, like a comet - blink-and-miss. I liked only 4 poems out of them all, but they are among those I often like to read frequently for their common-sense and quaint charm, such as 'Tyger', with its gripping structure and short lines, Or The Clod and the Pebble: Love seeketh not itself to please, nor for itself hath any care, but for another gives its ease and builds a Heaven in Hell's despair. or A Poison Tree, which was a simple but beautiful piece. But London by far remains my favorite, and I quote it here in full: I wander thro' each charter'd street, Near where the charter'd Thames does flow. And mark in every face I meet Marks of weakness, marks of woe. In every cry of every Man, In every Infant's cry of fear, In every voice: in every ban, The mind-forg'd manacles I hear. How the Chimney-sweepers cry Every blackning Church appalls, And the hapless Soldier's sigh Runs in blood down Palace walls. But most thro' midnight streets I hear How the youthful Harlot's curse Blasts the new-born Infant's tear And blights with plagues the Marriage hearse. Overall, I'm rather disappointed. Not only has a childhood favorite collection become a 3-star average affair now, but Blake, as a whole, has come a few steps down the tier. When I started over this book today, I'd expected to be blown over with brilliant images of innocence and experience, but the time has passed rather dully, but thankfully, briefly. The only saving grace is that I still love my old favorite pieces still, especially 'London'. Blake has become a little bleak for me now, but I still cherish the times he gave me, those little shiny lyrics that once upon a time brightened my moods with fond memories of a home I would never return to, of a garden that was no longer mine, of an innocence I was beginning to shed in favor of experience.",3,poetry,"['brush', 'blake', 'impeccable', 'poem', 'london', 'decade', 'get', 'read', 'poem', 'carefully', 'choose', 'academician', 'quickly', 'put', 'list', 'favorite', 'poet', 'reach', 'twenty', 'read', 'little', 'collection', 'like', 'immensely', 'song', 'innocence', 'look', 'naive', 'outlook', 'life', 'idyllic', 'picture', 'innocence', 'unwilling', 'leave', 'trek', 'youth', 'enamor', 'introductory', 'piece', 'pipe', 'valley', 'wild', 'piping', 'song', 'pleasant', 'glee', 'cloud', 'see', 'child', 'laugh', 'say', 'pipe', 'song', 'lamb', 'pipe', 'merry', 'chear', 'piper', 'pipe', 'song', 'pipe', 'weep', 'hear', 'drop', 'thy', 'pipe', 'thy', 'happy', 'pipe', 'sing', 'thy', 'song', 'happy', 'chear', 'sing', 'weep', 'joy', 'hear', 'piper', 'sit', 'thee', 'write', 'book', 'sight', 'hollow', 'reed', 'rural', 'pen', 'water', 'clear', 'write', 'happy', 'song', 'child', 'joy', 'hear', 'drop', 'amnesiac', 'honey', 'help', 'agony', 'house', 'shifting', 'summer', 'decade_ago', 'lush', 'green', 'safe', 'township', 'corner', 'city', 'close', 'city', 'concrete', 'lade', 'greenery', 'starve', 'space', 'crunch', 'area', 'bad', 'discover', 'later', 'beauty', 'greet', 'morning', 'sun', 'flank', 'luxurious', 'tree', 'amidst', 'warble', 'dozen', 'different', 'bird', 'remain', 'suddenly', 'wake', 'harsh', 'sun', 'shady', 'tree', 'hardly', 'bird', 'go', 'little', 'garden', 'small', 'home', 'large', 'home', 'barely', 'space', 'potted', 'plant', 'let', 'garden', 'yeah', 'poet', 'like', 'wordsworth', 'blake', 'lyrical', 'beauty', 'pastoral', 'happy', 'image', 'bleak', 'city', 'image', 'resonant', 'year_later', 'retain', 'nostalgia', 'magical', 'place', 'year', 'well', 'capable', 'judge', 'collection', 'new', 'perspective', 'shape', 'read', 'poem', 'get', 'shift', 'innocence', 'experience', 'value', 'equally', 'section', 'collection', 'song', 'innocence', 'simplistic', 'little', 'exquisite', 'craftsmanship', 'wordsworth', 'coleridge', 'browning', 'retain', 'sound', 'like', 'little', 'elementary', 'rhyme', 'structure', 'instead', 'breath', 'take', 'exhilaration', 'want', 'expect', 'nostalgia', 'sweep', 'occasionally', 'powerful', 'streak', 'thought', 'little', 'piece', 'divine', 'image', 'love', 'human', 'form', 'heathen', 'turk', 'jew', 'mercy', 'love', 'pity', 'dwell', 'god', 'dwell', 'song', 'experience', 'fare', 'well', 'glimmer', 'pain', 'come', 'experience', 'sense', 'enlightenment', 'exchange', 'world', 'unblemished', 'profound', 'innocence', 'bright', 'powerful', 'streak', 'end', 'soon', 'like', 'comet', 'blink', 'miss', 'like', 'poem', 'like', 'read', 'frequently', 'common', 'sense', 'quaint', 'charm', 'tyger', 'gripping', 'structure', 'short', 'line', 'clod', 'pebble', 'love', 'seeketh', 'hath', 'care', 'give', 'ease', 'build', 'heaven', 'hell', 'despair', 'poison', 'tree', 'simple', 'beautiful', 'piece', 'london', 'far', 'remain', 'favorite', 'quote', 'wander', 'thro', 'street', 'near', 'thames', 'flow', 'mark', 'face', 'meet', 'mark', 'weakness', 'mark', 'woe', 'cry', 'man', 'infant', 'cry', 'fear', 'voice', 'ban', 'mind', 'manacle', 'hear', 'chimney', 'sweeper', 'cry', 'blackne', 'church', 'appall', 'hapless', 'soldier', 'sigh', 'run', 'blood', 'palace', 'wall', 'thro', 'midnight', 'street', 'hear', 'youthful', 'harlot', 'curse', 'blast', 'new', 'bear', 'infant', 'tear', 'blight', 'plague', 'marriage', 'hearse', 'overall', 'disappointed', 'childhood', 'favorite', 'collection', 'star', 'average', 'affair', 'blake', 'come', 'step', 'tier', 'start', 'book', 'today', 'expect', 'blow', 'brilliant', 'image', 'innocence', 'experience', 'time', 'pass', 'dully', 'thankfully', 'briefly', 'saving', 'grace', 'love', 'old', 'favorite', 'piece', 'especially', 'london', 'blake', 'little', 'bleak', 'cherish', 'time', 'give', 'little', 'shiny', 'lyric', 'time', 'brighten', 'mood', 'fond', 'memory', 'home', 'return', 'garden', 'long', 'innocence', 'begin', 'shed', 'favor', 'experience']"
229,"A friend told me about those letters while driving me around at mid-night, without any certain destination. Those letters were among a few things remained in my exhausted mind that night. These days, overwhelmed with all the Tao, Wabisabi, Minimalism, I picked the book as a short break from all those heavy-philosophical stuffs. It was a great surprise. It feels like a long-lost friend sitting down beside and sharing about all the questions which have haunted me for the past 6 months - the question about knowing, love, solitude and fear of uncertainty. The letters were like a nice closing for that restless search, partly connecting all the fragmented answers which I got here and there. And, all those were delivered in a very comforting language. *About fear: ""Perhaps all the dragons in our lives are princesses who are only waiting to see us act, just once, with beauty and courage. Perhaps everything that frightens us is, in its deepest essence, something helpless that wants our love."" *About the doubt on knowing: """"I beg you, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books written in a very foreign language. Don't search for the answers, which could not be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point is to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the answer."" *About love: ""And this more human love, which will be carried out with infinite consideration and gentleness and will be good and clean in its tyings and untyings, will be like that love which we are straining and toiling to prepare, the love which consists in this, that two lonely beings protect one another, border upon one another and greet one another."" *About solitude: ""[A]t bottom, and just in the deepest and most important things, we are unutterably alone, and for one person to be able to advise or even help another, a lot must happen, a lot must go well, a whole constellation of things must come right in order once to succeed."" ...",4,poetry,"['friend', 'tell', 'letter', 'drive', 'mid', 'night', 'certain', 'destination', 'letter', 'thing', 'remain', 'exhausted', 'mind', 'night', 'day', 'overwhelm', 'tao', 'wabisabi', 'minimalism', 'pick', 'book', 'short', 'break', 'heavy', 'philosophical', 'stuff', 'great', 'surprise', 'feel', 'like', 'long', 'lose', 'friend', 'sit', 'share', 'question', 'haunt', 'past_month', 'question', 'knowing', 'love', 'solitude', 'fear', 'uncertainty', 'letter', 'like', 'nice', 'closing', 'restless', 'search', 'partly', 'connect', 'fragmented', 'answer', 'get', 'deliver', 'comforting', 'language', 'fear', 'dragon', 'life', 'princess', 'wait', 'act', 'beauty', 'courage', 'frighten', 'deep', 'essence', 'helpless', 'want', 'love', 'doubt', 'know', 'beg', 'patience', 'unresolved', 'heart', 'try', 'love', 'question', 'lock', 'room', 'book', 'write', 'foreign', 'language', 'search', 'answer', 'give', 'able', 'live', 'point', 'live', 'live', 'question', 'someday', 'far', 'future', 'gradually', 'notice', 'live', 'way', 'answer', 'love', 'human', 'love', 'carry', 'infinite', 'consideration', 'gentleness', 'good', 'clean', 'tying', 'untying', 'like', 'love', 'strain', 'toil', 'prepare', 'love', 'consist', 'lonely', 'being', 'protect', 'border', 'greet', 'solitude', 'deep', 'important', 'thing', 'unutterably', 'person', 'able', 'advise', 'help', 'lot', 'happen', 'lot', 'constellation', 'thing', 'come', 'right', 'order', 'succeed']"
230,"2.5 Stars I'm not a fan. I knew how low this book was rated on Goodreads before going into it, but I still wanted to give it a shot, so here we are! I LOVE books written in verse, and seeing as this book is <200 pages, it was a very quick read, and I got through it in about an hour. Which was honestly a plus. However, I often had a difficult time figuring out whether Ronit or Jamil was speaking on each page, and I quickly had to learn their respective parents' names to know who was talking. Other than that, the writing itself was alright. I enjoyed it, and I didn't hate it or anything, but it wasn't amazing or exciting or anything like that. As for the story itself, I just didn't like the romance. Which, you know, is kind of important to like when it's the main point of the book. It was very insta-lovey, and it felt like there was no build-up at all to a relationship of any sort. All they ever talked about was their lust for each other, and I felt that I missed both the entire chunk of the beginning of their relationship as well as the actual romance? A lot of the book was just talked about how much they ""wanted each other"" and using strange metaphors for it and just... why? I wasn't a fan of the ending either. I understand why the author did it, but it definitely didn't live up to my expectations, because HELLO. It's a Romeo and Juliet retelling. The most iconic thing is that they die. But no! They run off into the sunset together! Like, what??? It felt like all of the build-up didn't really go anywhere. Still, I liked the premise, and I absolutely understood what a horrible situation this would be, but since I didn't feel any actual LOVE in their romance at all, I couldn't really sympathize with them. Which was disappointing! Honestly, some of my favorite/most intriguing parts of the story were when their parents would speak. Their thoughts made sense and were much more heartbreaking and tragic than the actual ""romance"", unfortunately. It was worth a shot! If you do decide to pick this up, at least it is quite nice and short, so if you don't like it you should be able to get through it quickly. But fingers crossed you do!",2,poetry,"['star', 'fan', 'know', 'low', 'book', 'rate', 'goodreads', 'go', 'want', 'shot', 'love', 'book', 'write', 'verse', 'see', 'book', 'page', 'quick', 'read', 'get', 'hour', 'honestly', 'plus', 'difficult', 'time', 'figure', 'ronit_jamil', 'speak', 'page', 'quickly', 'learn', 'respective', 'parent', 'name', 'know', 'talk', 'writing', 'alright', 'enjoy', 'hate', 'amazing', 'exciting', 'like', 'story', 'like', 'romance', 'know', 'kind', 'important', 'like', 'main', 'point', 'book', 'insta', 'lovey', 'feel', 'like', 'build', 'relationship', 'sort', 'talk', 'lust', 'feel', 'miss', 'entire', 'chunk', 'beginning', 'relationship', 'actual', 'romance', 'lot', 'book', 'talk', 'want', 'strange', 'metaphor', 'fan', 'ending', 'understand', 'author', 'definitely', 'live', 'expectation', 'hello', 'romeo_juliet', 'retelling', 'iconic', 'thing', 'die', 'run', 'sunset', 'like', 'feel', 'like', 'build', 'like', 'premise', 'absolutely', 'understand', 'horrible', 'situation', 'feel', 'actual', 'love', 'romance', 'sympathize', 'disappointing', 'honestly', 'favorite', 'intriguing', 'part', 'story', 'parent', 'speak', 'thought', 'sense', 'heartbreaking', 'tragic', 'actual', 'romance', 'unfortunately', 'worth', 'shot', 'decide', 'pick', 'nice', 'short', 'like', 'able', 'quickly', 'finger', 'cross']"
231,"My guess is that ""Gentlemen"" is Shakespearean code for ""Buttheads."" Because The Two Buttheads of Verona fits the story much better. And the story is this: two friends, Proteus and Valentine, are bros for life. Proteus is in love with Julia and refuses to go out into the world to make his fortune until his daddy makes him. Off Proteus goes to join Valentine, who in the meantime has fallen for Silvia. Unfortunately for Julia, Proteus decides that Silvia is pretty hot. Therefore he decides to throw over both his best bud and his fiancee. He betrays their elopement plan to Silvia's Duke of a father and gets Valentine exiled, Silvia stuck, and Julia (who has decided to dress up like a page in order to get near her wayward fiance) in the cold. Proteus is a jerk. Even his servant, Lance says ""I think my master is something of a knave."" No sh*t. Did I mention the classic Shakespeare speech on ""No doesn't really mean no""? You'll find it here! Anyhoo -- Valentine and Proteus make up and become bros again. Valentine even offers to let Silvia marry Proteus. But Proteus apparently grows some kind of heart in the quickest monologue Shakespeare's ever written and that paragon of manhood decides that Julia -- even dressed as a boy -- is a-okay by him. Valentine gets to 'keep' Silvia and Julia -- that lucky duck -- gets to be with Proteus. Happy Ending All Around! The only reason I'm giving this two stars and not flushing it down some sewer bank is because you can see the bits that lead to some of his better, more well-rounded, works later on. And because one of the monologues was used in Shakespeare in Love.",2,poetry,"['guess', 'gentleman', 'shakespearean', 'code', 'butthead', 'buttheads', 'verona', 'fit', 'story', 'well', 'story', 'friend', 'proteus', 'valentine', 'bro', 'life', 'proteus', 'love', 'julia', 'refuse', 'world', 'fortune', 'daddy', 'make', 'proteus', 'go', 'join', 'valentine', 'meantime', 'fall', 'silvia', 'unfortunately', 'julia', 'proteus', 'decide', 'silvia', 'pretty', 'hot', 'decide', 'throw', 'good', 'bud', 'fiancee', 'betray', 'elopement', 'plan', 'silvia', 'duke', 'father', 'get', 'valentine', 'exile', 'silvia', 'stick', 'julia', 'decide', 'dress', 'like', 'page', 'order', 'near', 'wayward', 'fiance', 'cold', 'proteus', 'jerk', 'servant', 'lance', 'say', 'think', 'master', 'knave', 'mention', 'classic', 'shakespeare', 'speech', 'mean', 'find', 'anyhoo', 'valentine', 'proteus', 'bro', 'valentine', 'offer', 'let', 'silvia', 'marry', 'proteus', 'proteus', 'apparently', 'grow', 'kind', 'heart', 'quick', 'monologue', 'shakespeare', 'write', 'paragon', 'manhood', 'decide', 'julia', 'dress', 'boy', 'okay', 'valentine', 'get', 'silvia', 'julia', 'lucky', 'duck', 'get', 'proteus', 'happy_ending', 'reason', 'give_star', 'flush', 'sewer', 'bank', 'bit', 'lead', 'well', 'round', 'work', 'later', 'monologue', 'shakespeare', 'love']"
232,"""Your first love isn't the first person you give your heart to- it's the first one who breaks it."" 2 stars - It was okay This was such a huge disappointment. I love Lang Leav's writting and find her poetry to be beautiful, even if I only had a glimpse of it. What happened? In all honesty, I was going to give this book a 1 star rating at first. I had such a hard time going through the first half of it. From the overly dramatic and unrealistic story, everything seemed too much. It was trying too hard to be something. It was like the author wrote down on a paper what would make a hit book, somewhat like a Hollywood blockbuster, and tried to make it fit in less than 400 pages. So you needed a dead girl, a main character with health issues which was caused by unrepairable guilt, family issues, a perfect first boyfriend, a second boyfriend that would change everything, two best friends forever, a drug problem, a road to self discovery, another boyfriend that seemed yet again all perfect to just make the main character realize that boyfriend number 2 was the right one, a wedding, unrealistic job and housing opportunities, another sudden death and a plot twist within the last few pages. Should I go on? It was just a huge mix of ridiculousness. What ranked it up to a 2 stars was the second half. I did like Rad as a character and wanted to know what would happen to him and Audrey. It wasn't really based on the fact that it was the best relationship/love affair I have ever read about, it was simply out of pure guilty pleasure for cheesy romantic stories. It was also during the second half of the book that I got more of the beautiful writing I was expecting, even if it was very minimal. I wouldn't recommend this book. I believe that in order to truly appreciate the extent of Lang Leav's writing talent, her poetry will be the way to go.",2,poetry,"['love', 'person', 'heart_break', 'star', 'okay', 'huge', 'disappointment', 'love', 'lang_leav', 'writting', 'find', 'poetry', 'beautiful', 'glimpse', 'happen', 'honesty', 'go', 'book', 'star_rating', 'hard', 'time', 'go', 'half', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'unrealistic', 'story', 'try', 'hard', 'like', 'author', 'write', 'paper', 'hit', 'book', 'somewhat', 'like', 'hollywood', 'blockbuster', 'try', 'fit', 'page', 'need', 'dead', 'girl', 'main_character', 'health_issue', 'cause', 'unrepairable', 'guilt', 'family', 'issue', 'perfect', 'boyfriend', 'second', 'boyfriend', 'change', 'good', 'friend', 'forever', 'drug', 'problem', 'road', 'self', 'discovery', 'boyfriend', 'perfect', 'main_character', 'realize', 'boyfriend', 'number', 'right', 'wedding', 'unrealistic', 'job', 'housing', 'opportunity', 'sudden', 'death', 'plot_twist', 'page', 'huge', 'mix', 'ridiculousness', 'rank', 'star', 'second_half', 'like', 'rad', 'character', 'want', 'know', 'happen', 'audrey', 'base', 'fact', 'good', 'relationship', 'love', 'affair', 'read', 'simply', 'pure', 'guilty_pleasure', 'cheesy', 'romantic', 'story', 'second_half', 'book', 'get', 'beautiful', 'writing', 'expect', 'minimal', 'recommend', 'book', 'believe', 'order', 'truly', 'appreciate', 'extent', 'lang_leav', 'writing', 'talent', 'poetry', 'way']"
233,"I thought many of the poems were interesting, and liked how the poet combined modern body concepts and self esteem issues with classic fairy tales. However, I still felt like I was reading the poetry of an American teenager who was lost wallowing in angst. I did think that the cover of this book was absolutely beautiful. I also really liked the photography included among the poems. Some of my favorites from the collection include: A Brief History of Feminism I thought this was a clever depiction of sexual harassment. So often things start by creeping over that line, and covering it up by playing upon the insecurities of the female as being too sensitive, it wasn't meant that way. A Shape Magazine Fairy Tale Totally had to laugh at this. I feel like she called out the ""fitness"" magazine trend, that really is just a thinly concealed version of a fashion magazine. Putting it in fairy tale format just made the mockery even better for, since these magazines play into the princess fairy tale fantasy. Retelling What feminist hasn't looked beyond the surface of the fairy tale and wanted to shout, ""Stand up for yourself!"" and rewrite the tale of an empowered female?

234,"I received this through a first-reads book giveaway. It's a novel in verse about three women in their late thirties/early forties who are all friends and mothers. One is married to a decent guy but craves erotic adventure, another is a divorced single mother, and a third is married to a largely absent husband who is totally unhelpful as she struggles to care for a disabled toddler daughter and gay teenage son. This was an absorbing, if sometimes soap-operatic story, and the verse format didn't make it any less gripping. In fact, I never imagined I could enjoy a novel in the form of poems this much. I was often so oblivious to the fact that I was reading poetry that it's difficult for me even to tell whether I thought the poetry was good poetry or not. For that very reason, I don't think it could count as great poetry for the ages. However, I found myself in awe of the author's ambitiousness in choosing this form for her novel and how well she pulled it off. When I did notice the poetry, I was often impressed with the author's interesting word choices and verse structures. As a single mom to a pre-schooler and woman of a certain age, I definitely felt like the storylines in the book were ones I could relate to. The portions dealing with the disabled child were especially heartrending. One of the characters reconnects with her spirituality in part of the book, but to my relief it was mostly presented in a literary way, as one possible choice a person could make for her life among many others, rather than as covert sermonizing. Some parts of the book get fairly steamy, so that it reads a bit like a Harlequin romanice in spots. (It amused me because one characters joins a writing group and, wow, I'll just say, her writing group is whole lot more interesting than any I've ever gone to ...) I also found some of the steamy parts unrealistic (e.g., there's a scene where a character goes to a sex club and engages in some kinky stuff there ... I've never been to a sex club myself, but I've heard enough first-hand accounts to be fairly certain that they tend to involve a lot more old, fat, funny-looking people then the book's idealized scene would lead you to believe ). (Content warning for my LDS reader friends: besides the aforementioned steaminess, there is also a girl-on-girl sex scene !)

236,"An awesome, epic tale. For my first reading of ""Beowulf"" I read Tolkien's translation. Now, I heard that this might not necessarily be the best translation (Heaney's might be better), but it was the first translation of ""Beowulf"" that got everyone interested in the text, not as a historical artifact, but as a piece of poetry. My advice is to read it for the tale, not the prose, I suppose. The notes on the text are literally hundreds of pages long, so I skipped over most of that. I began by reading ""The Lay of Beowulf"" so that I knew what it was about. He kills two demons and then later kills a dragon while being slain himself. Then I jumped into the story, and what a ride! There aren't really any quotable lines, so it was just the plot itself that was really memorable, I suppose. Also, I was getting super excited because I could see all the parts that had influences on Tolkien's legendarium! The names alone made me smile....Beow, Ecgtheow, Froda, even an Eomer! Some phrases were definitely reused in some of his later works. ""Far over the misty moorlands cold where the wild wolf howled upon the wold, past dragon's lair and nicor's hold, and far from the lights of Heorot."" Sound familiar? Not to mention the dragon and his hoard.. The style itself reminds me very much of The Silmarillion.

237,"Last year one of the highlights of my Fall reading was Matthew Quick's lovely Boy21, which only failed perfect marks from me for two reasons: the title character's changing felt the faintest bit unrealistic, and the basketball failed to compel me at all. The Crossover has neither of those problems: I care nothing for sports, not even the tiniest bit, yet I felt as if every scene on the court was electric. And Josh evolves perfectly, subtly, without artifice. And talk about a great opening. The first few bits of verse, written like rap, hooked me. They were absolutely stunning. The rest of the book's writing is great too, but I was extremely disappointed that Alexander chose not to write the whole thing in a similar cadence. (Then again, if he had he may have been accused of gimmickry.) I'm extremely fond of verse novels regardless, so it was no huge problem for me. But man, it would've been great. Josh is a great kid, one who feels completely like a real boy. The characters around him were a lot less compelling, unfortunately. Realistic? Sure. Not particularly distinctive? Well, aside from the parents, who I loved, not really. I feel like I barely got to know Jordan, or the others (whose names I cannot remember, not a good sign). But the parents! God, the parents. The tough mom and the fun but tragically foolish father were huge highlights of the story for me, and I wish we'd had more time to spend with them. I also wish that the dad hadn't died , but it was handled very well despite me wishing that something, anything else had happened. I saw it coming a mile away (it was not so much foreshadowing as much as a giant red flag, really), and I hoped like you wouldn't believe that the story wouldn't take that particular turn. Despite that, it didn't feel like a cheap emotion grab. Nothing in this story did, though, and that's why I enjoyed it so much. I can imagine hordes of middle school boys (and girls, of course) reading this for a class and loving it. It may have a bit of geeky words to it, but it's very well-done, and emotionally honest in a way that, I think, can really speak to kids.",4,poetry,"['year', 'highlight', 'fall', 'reading', 'matthew', 'quick', 'lovely', 'fail', 'perfect', 'mark', 'reason', 'title', 'character', 'changing', 'feel', 'faint', 'bit', 'unrealistic', 'basketball', 'fail', 'compel', 'crossover', 'problem', 'care', 'sport', 'tiny', 'bit', 'feel', 'scene', 'court', 'electric', 'josh', 'evolve', 'perfectly', 'subtly', 'artifice', 'talk', 'great', 'opening', 'bit', 'verse', 'write', 'like', 'rap', 'hook', 'absolutely', 'stunning', 'rest', 'book', 'writing', 'great', 'extremely', 'disappoint', 'alexander', 'choose', 'write', 'thing', 'similar', 'cadence', 'accuse', 'gimmickry', 'extremely', 'fond', 'verse', 'novel', 'regardless', 'huge', 'problem', 'man', 'great', 'josh', 'great', 'kid', 'feel', 'completely', 'like', 'real', 'boy', 'character', 'lot', 'compelling', 'unfortunately', 'realistic', 'sure', 'particularly', 'distinctive', 'aside', 'parent', 'love', 'feel', 'like', 'barely', 'get', 'know', 'jordan', 'name', 'remember', 'good', 'sign', 'parent', 'god', 'parent', 'tough', 'mom', 'fun', 'tragically', 'foolish', 'father', 'huge', 'highlight', 'story', 'wish', 'time', 'spend', 'wish', 'dad', 'die', 'handle', 'despite', 'wish', 'happen', 'see', 'come', 'mile', 'away', 'foreshadowing', 'giant', 'red', 'flag', 'hope', 'like', 'believe', 'story', 'particular', 'turn', 'despite', 'feel', 'like', 'cheap', 'emotion', 'grab', 'story', 'enjoy', 'imagine', 'horde', 'middle_school', 'boy', 'girl', 'course', 'read', 'class', 'love', 'bit', 'geeky', 'word', 'emotionally', 'honest', 'way', 'think', 'speak', 'kid']"
238,"""..He gives me power like an amulet cherishes my voice like it's the Bible asks my opinion like it's a prize.."" Setting: 4 out of 5 aoe(c)aoe(c)aoe(c)aoe(c) The prose form of this narrative was actually quite appealing to me. Though there were parts that fell flat, I loved the parallelism between Ronit being an Israeli and Jamil being a Palestinian. The political and geographical conflict plays a key role in this story. Writing: 3 out of 5 aoe(c)aoe(c)aoe(c) This Romeo-and-Juliet retelling is clever in incorporating political aspects rather than family feuds. The food, cultural references, teenage angst, etc. felt real - it showed how people across the world are similar to us in the most normal ways. However, some parts of the story felt heavy with the burden of death and pain while other parts felt too simple and out of place. I enjoyed the prose whenever I went back to recite it over and over again until I found its meaning. I appreciated it, because Middle Easterners are known for recitation, which makes me think if the story would serve better in Arabic or Bengali. In this case, less is more. The prose narrative was appropriate, because had it been a novel, several morals and beliefs would have been brought into question from both sides rather than portraying a romantic story. Character development: 3 out of 5 aoe(c)aoe(c)aoe(c) Although I appreciated the story, Ronit and Jamil's characters were already somewhat predetermined. I liked how Ronit was made out to be the eldest daughter who carried all the burden on her shoulders while Jamil was more of a dreamer who couldn't be himself around his own father. In the beginning, I was a little confused trying to discern the two perspectives, but once I understood, I recognized the ironic similarities and differences between Ronit and Jamil. Plot twist / storyline: 3 out of 5 aoe(c)aoe(c)aoe(c) This story would have been twice as better if it wasn't a Romeo-and-Juliet retelling but rather a love story between an Israeli and Palestinian. However, I've got to say that I liked how she ended the story differently than what was expected. ""He calls himself a Zionist I call him fish for the way he stays in deep waters (where others would drown) admonishing his only son for giving out drugs to Arabs, smiling sadistically drinking blood for breakfast."" Theme/message: 4 out of 5 aoe(c)aoe(c)aoe(c)aoe(c) The ideological viewpoints and violence portrayed in this story portrays the ""blind intransigence"" as Laskin mentions in her acknowledgments. It is crazy to think that a political and territorial feud that began decades ago is still affecting people today on the other side of the world. I think this book deserves recognition, because so many of us disregard the reality of world politics. 3.4 stars aoe(c)aoe(c)aoe(c)",3,poetry,"['give', 'power', 'like', 'amulet', 'cherish', 'voice', 'like', 'bible', 'ask', 'opinion', 'like', 'prize', 'setting', 'prose', 'form', 'narrative', 'actually', 'appealing', 'part', 'fall_flat', 'love', 'parallelism', 'ronit', 'israeli', 'jamil', 'palestinian', 'political', 'geographical', 'conflict', 'play', 'key', 'role', 'story', 'writing', 'romeo_juliet', 'retelling', 'clever', 'incorporate', 'political_aspect', 'family', 'feud', 'food', 'cultural', 'reference', 'teenage_angst', 'etc', 'feel', 'real', 'show', 'people', 'world', 'similar', 'normal', 'way', 'part', 'story', 'feel', 'heavy', 'burden', 'death', 'pain', 'part', 'feel', 'simple', 'place', 'enjoy', 'prose', 'go', 'recite', 'find', 'meaning', 'appreciate', 'middle', 'easterners', 'know', 'recitation', 'make', 'think', 'story', 'serve', 'well', 'arabic', 'bengali', 'case', 'prose', 'narrative', 'appropriate', 'novel', 'moral', 'belief', 'bring', 'question', 'side', 'portray', 'romantic', 'story', 'character_development', 'appreciate', 'story', 'ronit_jamil', 'character', 'somewhat', 'predetermine', 'like', 'ronit', 'eld', 'daughter', 'carry', 'burden', 'shoulder', 'jamil', 'dreamer', 'father', 'beginning', 'little', 'confused', 'try', 'discern', 'perspective', 'understand', 'recognize', 'ironic', 'similarity', 'difference', 'ronit_jamil', 'plot_twist', 'storyline', 'story', 'twice', 'well', 'romeo_juliet', 'retelling', 'love', 'story', 'israeli', 'palestinian', 'get', 'like', 'end', 'story', 'differently', 'expect', 'call', 'zionist', 'fish', 'way', 'stay', 'deep', 'water', 'drown', 'admonish', 'son', 'give', 'drug', 'arabs', 'smile', 'sadistically', 'drink', 'blood', 'breakfast', 'theme', 'message', 'ideological', 'viewpoint', 'violence', 'portray', 'story', 'portray', 'blind', 'intransigence', 'laskin', 'mention', 'acknowledgment', 'crazy', 'think', 'political', 'territorial', 'feud', 'begin', 'decade_ago', 'affect', 'people', 'today', 'world', 'think', 'book', 'deserve', 'recognition', 'disregard', 'reality', 'world', 'politic', 'star']"

240,"I wasn't expecting to love this book as much as I did, but We Come Apart is probably my favourite book of the year thus far (I'm actually hoping that it's not the only book I'll give more than 4 stars to, but we'll see). We Come Apart is beautifully written; it's actually in verse, with dual POV from the main characters, Jess and Nicu. I once wrote in a review that I find epistolary novels really hard to get into, and novels written in verse are no exception to this feeling. Which is why I was really surprised that I connected so much to the characters and enjoyed the book so much. I do really think this is a testament to the authors' writing ability. The two things I loved about this book were the characters and the writing. The authors present characters with depth who are realistic and have to deal with their own struggles and flaws. I felt a lot of injustice and anger at the way both Jess and Nicu were treated at times in the story, but also felt joy and happiness when they found times where they could be themselves and when they started to realise the love that was blossoming between them. This novel deals with some interesting and important issues. To put it plainly, Jess has a hard home life; both her mother and her go through domestic abuse that her stepfather puts them through. As well, she is dealing with issues with friends and is finding it hard to understand who she really wants to be. On the other hand, there is Nicu, who only recently moved to England, and who does not know much English and struggles to make friends. His traditional father also pressures him to get married and move back to their homeland. At first, I wasn't sure how two characters with such different lives could ever meet, let alone become friends. But their friendship was written so well that it felt realistic and organic. Throughout the novel, the characters go through so much and show a lot of character growth, especially in regards to the attitudes and outlook that they have before. The writing was also lyrical and just a joy to read. It was easy to understand and was never overly descriptive or metaphorical. I think it very much suited the story. The two POVs have such a different writing style which really provides insight into the two characters, but never felt forced and went well together. You do really come to care for the characters and invest in their stories. If there was one drawback, it's the ending. I haven't read any other reviews so I'm not sure if this was an issue for other reviewers or maybe it's just me, but I really did not like the ending. I think this is partially because I did come to connect and care for the characters in the story so much, which made me feel that much worse when things didn't pan out so well. To an extent, I also think the ending was kind of realistic it's not a HEA, that's for sure . But, I have to admit, I felt sort of betrayed. The ending just came out of nowhere, and it was quite abrupt. I wasn't expecting it. And I feel, after the lead up of the whole story, for it to end like that with Jess leaving on the train by herself because of Nicu's selfless actions , it defeated the whole point of the story. There was never a clear moral to the story, but I felt confused as to how we, the reader, was meant to feel after the ending. Were we meant to feel like life is unfair and sometimes it remains that way? Which is a super depressing question to leave the readers with. As well, the ambiguous ending left so many questions unanswered. It felt unfinished; I wanted to know what would happen to the characters. They ran away from their problems and nothing was resolved. I wanted to know what would happen to Nicu. Were we meant to believe that he would finally have to succumb to his father's wishes? How about Jess? Was she destined to make a new life somewhere, when she's hardly independent, and never see her parents again? How about Jess and Nicu? What happens to their friendship, the bond they had only just begun to embrace? Overall, the ending left much to be desired and left me feeling unsatisfied and let down. I don't want to detract from the novel too much, because it was still a really good book. I loved the characters (maybe a little too much) and the writing style and the way it made me feel so many emotions. That's why, even after the ending (which is always a very important element to me), it still gets 4.5/4 1/4 stars (I still haven't decided). We Come Apart is such a great story that unfortunately did have an ending that wasn't satisfactory. I still think it's worth reading regardless of the ending, but just a warning it won't leave you feeling very happy at all.

243,"Each page of the unconventional format of this book contains a title, an image, and a little blurb that is like the quotable lines of a poem sans the context of a full poem. Since the author wrote this for me, I'm keeping a journal of my experience reading it I had just finished Juliet and was in a super romantic mood. And then listened to Indigo Girls cover of Romeo & Juliet and compounded my romanticness with wistful nostalgia. Then read a few pages of this book and had this reaction: It's like a Roschach painting. You bring your own life experiences and past relationships to the table and use them as a lens through which you can make each poem/piece have meaning for you. If you bring emotionally rich history with you to the table and then open yourself up to tap back into it via the text and imagery presented in the book, I imagine you can have a rich experience reading this book indeed. But if you're not willing to try to make that connection between the material and your own life, you will probably be closed off from the beauty of this book. Or, if you've never loved, or been loved, or had your heart broken, or broke someone's heart, or longed for someone who was out of your reach, I imagine reading this book would be a different experience altogether. I guess you would have to read it and construct the character of ""you"" in your mind. Which might be enjoyable as well - conjecturing on what happened between the ""I""/author and the ""you"" that the author addresses. This rest of this review is spoilery and not necessary to read. Just know that you might like this book and you might not. It just depends if you are willing to open yourself up to the emotions it elicits. 11/12/14 Woke up and read some more and in the cold light of a new day felt a bit more cynical about it. Some of the sentiments reminded me of past fixations that were not so healthy. Being reminded of times when I thought love meant being wholly consumed by another person and letting the sun rise and set by their acceptance or rejection. I'm in a different headspace of what I want out of a relationship, so perhaps it's harder for me to indulge in the ""give it all up for love"" mentality. It's a little too much to read all at once so I shall read a bit at a time. These could be a collection of greeting card innards, but like an artful, sensitive, romantic, non-cheesy, but truly vulnerable-making heartfelt greeting card company. These are confessional notes anyone would dream of receiving. They're love letters made public. This is making me feel crazy nostalgic for when I was in young love. Several of these would make stellar wedding toasts. Geez, each page packs an emotional punch or requires reflection. I like to read only a couple pages at a time so I can take a few moments to absorb. But if I read too many pages in a row I start losing the emotional punch and it starts feeling like piled on or less genuine and they start just becoming good lines, intended to manipulate the reader. I forgot how much I love love. It's hard to jump into these intensely personal and vulnerable declarations without any context or development of characters. You have to just give it the benefit of the doubt that these are genuine sentiments and engage with the possibility of it. As a reader, it's an experiment and you get out of it what you will. ""The DIaries of Foreign Lovers You are so patriotic to your heart. It keeps the country together. But it tears the world apart."" Gah! it jumps from totally devastating, tapping into that feeling of lost love, to the next page, totally heart-happy young love with romantic exuberance, to heart-stoppingly romantic talk that elicits a ""get-in-my-bed-nao"" response. I like the fluidity of the ""you."" These statements seem directed at many different people in many different contexts, and goes to prove how personal and universal our experiences are. It's like those 'stories told in 6 words' meme. There are whole worlds and stories behind these few lines. ""The Forgotten Star You keep telling me to be glad for what we had while we had it. That the brightest flame burns quickest. Which means you saw us as a candle. And I saw us as the sun."" Ok, we are no longer jumping through the spectrum of love, we seem to have shifted to a new phase of breakup torment. My heart! Now I'm plowing through because I don't want to sit with this looking back on love. It hits too close to home and no reflection is necessary. Resolution, moving on, how to get through it, however, are sentiments I wouldn't mind being illuminated. Wow, this is rough. Might need to step away for a bit. ""The City Rises and Falls You were a dream. Then a reality. Now a memory."" Ah, the ""you"" is shifting. I love how gradual this is. I'm loving this new phase. I hope the author would forgive me using his/her poetry as self-help. I love how it evolves from writing for someone else to writing for oneself.

244,"2 out of 5 stars Youth is wasted on the young. I can't say I had high expectations for this book. Over the stretch of time that has lapsed between her last and latest publication, my senior writing peers have taken up the responsibility of removing Lang Leav from the immeasurably high pedestal in my heart. I fell in love with her first book, you see. Love and Misadventures became my holy grail in poetry when I read it when it was first published. Her points when it came to love and loss was so acute, she put stars in my eyes. So after that, I bought more of her books as soon as they were published (despite the obvious hole it left in my wallet). The magic of her words slowly faded. I know where her words were coming from, but I'm not that sure if she was writing for herself now. That's how I felt after Lullabies, Memories, and The Universe of Us but I brushed the thought the instant it came to mind and thought, Nonsense. I'm reading too much into it. All writers struggle to write for themselves to justify the truth they know and want to impart. But deep inside I still asked myself,  Is her poetry the only poetry I know? And it was true, I never knew the classics. Name one famous dead poet and I wouldn't even have a clue. But let's put aside the matter of my doubts regarding her credibility as a poet, let's talk about her new book. In the dying embers and blackened twigs of a ravaged forest, who could distinguish where the first spark was lit? Only the arsonist knows the exact location on which the first match was struck. It is Audrey Field's final weeks in school when she shatters the already precarious nature of her life and of everyone she knows with a single, repulsive lie. It leads to a dangerous chain of events -the death of her melancholic classmate Ana, the start of her breathless panic attacks, her best friend Candela throwing her life away, the spark of an ill-timed romance with Ana's enigmatic boyfriend Rad, and the revelation of a deadly secret. ""I think it's because we romanticize the past. We give it more than it deserves."" Sad Girls revolves around writers, the mass effect of uttering a thoughtless lie, the value of friendships, the meaning of true love, freedom, finding one's place in the world, heartbreaks, (wasting) second chances, dreams, uncovering false appearances and the significance of the truth -which brings me to my admission that I didn't quite like this one. Audrey is one of the biggest reasons. You could imagine my incredulity upon finding out what kind of horrible lie that caused, not only hers, but everyone's lives to fall apart. INCEST. Between her classmate and her OWN father. No lie is more disgusting and I couldn't believe she said it, so casually and I quote,  earnestly  to her best friends (one of which was Ana's close friend), just for the heck of it and didn't even bother to take it back right then and there. No sane person would ever do that, and I felt that the remorse and guilt that attacked her until the end of the novel wasn't enough punishment for her ridiculous tongue. There were handful of times where her words went far out of line. She also didn't endeavor to completely mend her rocky relationship with her mother. She surreptitiously sneaked around her boyfriend's back to hung out with the boyfriend of the sad girl whose demise was brought upon her revolting lie. She wasn't the least honest about her obligated relationship with Duck to him, to everyone and to herself. There were also a lot of loose ends to tie up. Like the ambiguity of Candela's relationship with Ana. Candela: ""I know what you're implying about me and Ana, and do you know what? It's none of your fucking business."" Ana (about Rad): I know he thinks he's in love. But he has no idea what love is. Not yet anyway. So, it's safe to assume that Ana wasn't really in love with Rad, and Candela saw her as more than a sister figure from the way she got into a bad crowd, resorted to drugs and became highly sensitive when anyone brought her up. Seeing how intense her grief is, affection for her deceased close friend is definitely possible since Candela's first fling was also a female, and maybe, Ana also reciprocated her feelings since she had a picture of her in the locket she immensely treasured (enough to be used as a bookmark). Most likely Rad had suspected it, knew it wasn't him in her locket all along and only looked inside for confirmation and to appease Audrey's suggestion. If Duck's man periods level on extremes (pitiful Audrey putting up with every single one of it), he becomes downright terrifying in post breakups, especially when he's drunk. He was blinded by love (obsession?) for Audrey, and it was almost touching until he raged in front of her window, his chivalry evaporated into thin air. I wanted to see more of his character development from when Audrey broke up with him because no matter what, even when there were several moments where I adored his tenderness and sweetness, his lasting impression was a psycho (from his bipolar mood swings), even after he found a new girl and quoted to Audrey, ""Everything happens for a reason."" Also, WAS I THE ONLY ONE WHO ABSOLUTELY ADORED GABE? I mean, he was the normal one out of all Audrey's love interests. Optimistic and funny, he was a ball of sunshine and he deeply respected her boundaries as well, completely unassuming and only acting upon his feelings as long as Audrey allowed it. Bittersweetly, he chose to let her go, wishing for nothing but her happiness. ""I don't think I can do the friend thing. Not with you."" HE WAS SUCH A KEEPER. AUDREY, YOU IDIOT. YOU MISSED THE ROAD TRIP OF YOUR LIFE. Rad, on the other hand, was your typical enigmatic hottie with heterochromatic eyes which only intensified the mystery that veiled around him. Witty and well-acquainted with the woes of a writer, he charmed his way to Audrey's broken, guilt-ridden heart. From the start, I was always skeptical about him. Initially, I thought that his refusal to talk about anything regarding Ana, his easygoing attitude and his desire to frequently spend time with Audrey were commonplace actions of one who was grieving the death of his love. I believed he was trying to move on from her by ignoring the fact, but it was so much more. He was trying to bury the guilt --through writing, finding someone new, ripping a suicide note from his girlfriend's diary and keeping it, maybe to convince himself that she wanted the accident. He was the most cowardly of all the characters in Sad Girls, I concluded. The only answer I could piece together from his inhumane decisions was that his mental health degraded during his relationship with suicidal Ana. It's toxicity retained in himself and jumbled up the meaning of what's right and wrong. I mean, after unintentionally killing your own lover and staging it as suicide, guilt was bound to eat you up and squeeze the truth from you. But his conscience didn't work or maybe, it was long dead anyway. He had no decency, even continuing his life, pursuing his aspirations and a girl who was obviously taken. (She matched his standards --sad, lonely and broken.) Though the book ended on a really disturbing note, I could say Audrey and Rad were perfect for each other, running away from the grave sins they had committed to start over a clean slate, neglecting their conscience, fulfilling their dreams like the past was just nothing and Audrey leaving her doting friends in the dark. Two wolves bound to devour each other alive. The liar and the killer. Bonnie and Clyde. Harley and Joker. Bring on the titles. And before I come into a conclusion, let me express my rage: WHY DID MY CINNAMON ROLL FREDDY HAVE TO DIE? WHY DID SWEET SWEET LUCY HAVE TO BE MISERABLE? THEY'RE THE MOST DESERVING COUPLE WHEN IT COMES TO HAPPINESS, WHY BREAK THEM APART? The truth will come out eventually. No need to destroy the most lovable (and cheesiest) couple in the book. Sheesh. My gut was right when it was feeling uneasy as I went through Lucy's odd mini-speech: ""But he was my first real boyfriend. I don't have anyone else to compare him with. What if he isn't the love of my life and I'm just sticking with him because I've never known anything else?"" There you go, Lucy. In Sad Girls, Lang Leav skirts through sensitive subjects with the aloofness and subtlety of a freight train. But I greatly appreciated her raw tribute to writers. ""But I don't think all writers are sad. It's the other way around --all sad people write. It's a form of catharsis, a way of working through things that feel unresolved, like undoing a knot. People who are prone to sadness are more likely to pick up a pen."" As a debut novel, it wasn't so much of an okay shot, but I would've loved it more if she imposed the writing style she uses when composing prose. Despondency, Dead Butterflies, Rogue Planets, The Professor and Three Questions were some of my favorites. Years back when I first read them, I believed I was given a glimpse of how she would write her novel in the near future and I was considerably excited. Now, it's not that she disappointed me. It's just that somehow I just knew it would come to this and it's okay. I'm a patient girl. She will overcome herself, especially when everyone is given chances and has the right to use them (excluding Audrey and Rad though, unless if they did it the right way). I am always rooting for my childhood favorite and I hope to see her considerably grow in the next years to come. Meanwhile, let me say: My youth (and money) is wasted on this book. This has been a quite long review, and I thank anyone who has spent time to read my thoughts! And one last thing, Ana's notion of love, though maybe solid truth to others, will continue to haunt me: The truth is, everyone wants to believe they're in love but no one really is. So to all the girls out there who are stuck between two minds about some stupid crush, I have news for you. If you have to wonder, if you have to question what you feel, then deep down you actually don't give a shit. As for the rest of you who don't get it, welcome to the club. If you know what it's like to want someone so much you would kill for them. If you know what it's like to feel someone so deep under your skin you would sacrifice everything to protect them --even if it screws up your own moral compass so you can't see right from wrong. If you're like me, then let me leave you with this: That's what love is. Don't let them tell you any different. Don't tell yourself otherwise.",2,poetry,"['star', 'youth', 'waste', 'young', 'high_expectation', 'book', 'stretch', 'time', 'lapse', 'late', 'publication', 'senior', 'write', 'peer', 'take',

245,"This book was definitely not written for someone like me, but that's okay! Great option for younger readers in the YA/Teen department, like the middle schoolers transitioning to the teen department. This book is written in prose, which makes it a quicker read that focuses on senses, particularly in the basketball scenes. There is a lot to unpack in this book about brother relationships, friendships among boys, how romantic relationships impact friendships, jealousy, loss of a parent , and dealing with the impact of our own actions. Josh and his family all make a positive impact on each other in some way and there is significant character development for the narrator, Josh.",4,poetry,"['book', 'definitely', 'write', 'like', 'okay', 'great', 'option', 'young', 'reader', 'ya', 'teen', 'department', 'like', 'middle', 'schooler', 'transition', 'teen', 'department', 'book', 'write', 'prose', 'make', 'quick', 'read', 'focus', 'sense', 'particularly', 'basketball', 'scene', 'lot', 'unpack', 'book', 'brother', 'relationship', 'friendship', 'boy', 'romantic_relationship', 'impact', 'friendship', 'jealousy', 'loss', 'parent', 'deal', 'impact', 'action', 'josh', 'family', 'positive', 'impact', 'way', 'significant', 'character_development', 'narrator', 'josh']"
246,"""There is danger in sanity"" - Ariadne First off, this is my first in depth review of something on Goodreads, so forgive me if this becomes more like an essay than a review xD Second, this was a very quick and interesting read and I definitely recommend giving it a look. I have only recently developed an interest in mythology, so admittedly, I did not know much about the original myth of the Minotaur and what little I knew was censored and altered to be more child-friendly (definitely a bit of a shock when reading about the conception of Asterion...). Also, I know from the author's note at the end that he did take some liberties with aspects that are not given as much attention in the original. However, something I appreciate about adaptations like these are that they tend to spark interest in the original story without totally modifying the plot to fit their new twist. I believe this has done that very well. Each of the areas that the author gave some extra attention to gave the characters more of a realness that can sometimes be missing when reading classic mythology. Each of the characters were given such a unique personality. My two favorites were Poseidon and Asterion. I just have to say I love how sassy Poseidon is. The gods of Greek mythology were not just powerful, but quite chaotic and meddlesome, so to see his responses to all of the events that take place was really interesting for me. Also,  the fact that his only contribution to what happened was the initial attraction between the queen and the bull kind of blew my mind a bit. He definitely plays up his involvement only to reveal that he did not meddle beyond that. Everything falls apart due to human error, not divine intervention. I also appreciated the fact that Poseidon, while vengeful and eager to mess with Minos, was able to feel sympathy toward Asterion. It seemed almost as though Poseidon identified with Asterion's misfortune and related it to his own father-issues: ""The sins of the father are inflicted on the sons"". I really felt for Asterion. I liked what Elliott wrote when he said ""My sympathies have always aligned more strongly with Asterion, a boy, unlike most of us, whose deformities lay on the outside, visible for all to see"". I had definitely never seen a presentation of this myth where you really see the man behind the monster, so being able to see what he was like growing up and how, despite his lack of say in the matter, he was such an outsider for his origins definitely made him a more sympathetic character. I really enjoyed reading this and appreciated the author's choices of form for the characters (I have always found verse and the way authors can manipulate different forms to fit their plots fascinating, take a look at the end notes if you too enjoy that sort of thing!). Well written, great characters, and a unique adaptation of a classic story, I am glad I picked this one up!",4,poetry,"['danger', 'sanity', 'ariadne', 'depth', 'review', 'goodreads', 'forgive', 'like', 'essay', 'review', 'xd', 'second', 'quick', 'interesting', 'read', 'definitely_recommend', 'give', 'look', 'recently', 'develop', 'interest', 'mythology', 'admittedly', 'know', 'original', 'myth', 'minotaur', 'little', 'know', 'censor', 'alter', 'child', 'friendly', 'definitely', 'bit', 'shock', 'read', 'conception', 'asterion', 'know', 'author', 'note', 'end', 'liberty', 'aspect', 'give', 'attention', 'original', 'appreciate', 'adaptation', 'like', 'tend', 'spark', 'interest', 'original', 'story', 'totally', 'modify', 'plot', 'fit', 'new', 'twist', 'believe', 'area', 'author', 'give', 'extra', 'attention', 'give', 'character', 'realness', 'miss', 'read', 'classic', 'mythology', 'character', 'give', 'unique', 'personality', 'favorite', 'poseidon', 'asterion', 'love', 'sassy', 'poseidon', 'god', 'greek_mythology', 'powerful', 'chaotic', 'meddlesome', 'response', 'event', 'place', 'interesting', 'fact', 'contribution', 'happen', 'initial', 'attraction', 'queen', 'bull', 'kind', 'blow_mind', 'bit', 'definitely', 'play', 'involvement', 'reveal', 'meddle', 'fall_apart', 'human', 'error', 'divine', 'intervention', 'appreciate', 'fact', 'poseidon', 'vengeful', 'eager', 'mess', 'minos', 'able', 'feel', 'sympathy', 'asterion', 'poseidon', 'identify', 'asterion', 'misfortune', 'relate', 'father', 'issue', 'sin', 'father', 'inflict', 'son', 'feel', 'asterion', 'like', 'elliott', 'write', 'say', 'sympathy', 'align', 'strongly', 'asterion', 'boy', 'unlike', 'deformity', 'lie', 'outside', 'visible', 'definitely', 'see', 'presentation', 'myth', 'man', 'monster', 'able', 'like', 'grow', 'despite', 'lack', 'matter', 'outsider', 'origin', 'definitely', 'sympathetic', 'character', 'enjoy', 'read', 'appreciate', 'author', 'choice', 'form', 'character', 'find', 'verse', 'way', 'author', 'manipulate', 'different', 'form', 'fit', 'plot', 'fascinating', 'look', 'end', 'note', 'enjoy', 'sort', 'thing', 'write', 'great', 'character', 'unique', 'adaptation', 'classic', 'story', 'glad', 'pick']"
247,"The Crossover has me thinking about the inevitable Newbery Medal argument a lot. It basically goes like this, if you aren't familiar with it: ""Newbery books make children hate reading! They're depressing and hard and much more appealing to adults than to children!"" It's an argument that both fascinates and annoys me, since it's not like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone stops existing just because Louis Sachar won the award for Holes the year it was published. It also tends to ignore the fact that 1) and 2) there are children out there who really do love many Newbery winners, not to mention that there are many Newbery books that have large numbers of incredibly devoted fans. (Holes is one that comes to mind, along with The Westing Game, The Giver, Walk Two Moons, and The Tale of Desperaux.) Every book isn't going to be a winner in the long term, but that's how any award given on merit without the benefit of hindsight works. (For me, that makes things even more fun--how strange it is to imagine a Newbery committee who thought Charlotte's Web was not for all time but for an age, for instance. :D) So where does The Crossover fit into this argument? It's a fast read, which is a point in favour for its readability for children. It's about a boy who plays sports, which should be a draw to boys who might dislike a lot of the more family-drama-oriented Newbery selections. It's also poetry about a boy who plays sports, which may well be a turnoff to those same boys, and the plot follows the traditional Newbery pattern of ""don't expect the main character's most beloved relative to survive the book"" to a T . But is that necessarily a bad thing? Is it playing to old tropes that are depressing as fuck or presenting a truth many of the book's audience will have to deal with in their lives? Sometimes I think there's no winning with the Newbery selections--unless, of course, you're the one who ends up holding the medal. Regardless, and without the benefit of any real hindsight less than a year after the award was given, I think this is a marvelous book. The poetry is energetic on the page as well as when read aloud, especially the parts about playing ball. Josh's words dominate the page when he's on the court, stretching and shouting joyfully over the white space. In his private life, things are more chill, and there, his world really takes shape. The premise of the book really is a great draw--who doesn't want to be in the shoes of a star basketball player whose dad used to play professionally?--and the family relationships are incredibly warm and positive. It's a wonderful book to get lost in, even when conflict tests the depths of those same characters' relationships. (About the only thing that distracted the hell out of me was choosing to name the main character Joshua Bell. Children are unlikely to have trouble ignoring their mental image of that other Joshua Bell, but for me, it jarred me out of the story at times, lol. I loved his nickname, though--what a great way to get kids to youtube some classic jazz!) Definitely one to recommend to everyone you know.

I don't feel like it adds value to the poems at all, and in comparison to the words, they pale in art. The poems are okay - some I actually enjoy. My favourite is ""The Twins"" and it goes like this: ""I like to think that somewhere out there, on a planet exactly like ours, two people exactly like you and me made totally different choices and that, somewhere, we're still together."" I thought that the idea of doppelgangers in an alternative universe making the choices that you wish you have made, is quite a sweet but sad way of describing a breakup.

251,"I really really recommend this one. Go read it. i will tell you about selfish people. even when they know they will hurt you they walk into your life to taste you because you are the type of being they don't want to miss out on. you are too much shine to not be felt. so when they have gotten a good look at everything you have to offer. when they have taken your skin your hair and your secrets with them. when they realize how real this is. how much of a storm you are and it hits them. that is when the cowardice sets in. that is when the person you thought they were is replaced by the sad reality of what they are. that is when they lose every fighting bone in their body and leave after saying you will find better than me. you will stand there naked with half of them still hidden somewhere inside you and sob. asking them why they did it. why they forced you to love them when they had no intention of loving you back and they'll say something along the lines of i just had to try, i had to give it a chance, it was you after all. but that isn't romantic. it isn't sweet. the idea that they were so engulfed by your existence they had to risk breaking it for the sake of knowing they weren't missing out. your existence meant that little next to their curiosity of you. that is the thing about selfish people. they gamble entire beings. entire souls to please their own. one second they are holding you like the world and the next they have belittled you to a mere picture, a moment, something of the past. one second, they swallow you up and whisper they want to spend the rest of their life with you but the moment they sense fear, they are already halfway out the door. without having the nerve to let you go with grace, as if the human heart means that little to them. and after all this. after all of the taking. the nerve. isn't it sad and funny how people have more guts these days to undress you with their fingers than they do to pick up the phone and call. apologize. for all of the loss. and this is how you lose her. -selfish That's my favorite one.

253,"Personally, I'm completely not into sports, so all the sports drama didn't appeal to me. However, the verse form grabs your attention and keeps it. This book is incredibly well written - sports as metaphor for life really worked well here, and not always in an in-your-face, hey listen up kids way, but in much more subtle and poignant ways. If I took Goodreads' ratings as about how good I think a book is versus whether I liked it personally, it'd get more stars. It was a little slow for me in the first half because of the emphasis on sports, but I was more invested the more it became about sibling, father/son, and family dynamics. I also really liked the strong mom character who's so educated and intelligent, but without the parental relationship devolving into a competent wife/bumbling dad cliche. The ending was  somewhat expected, but I definitely got a little teary eyed when Josh's dad died.

254,"Not one of my favourite Shakespeare plays, but certainly a worthwhile read. The main character of Hamlet was really interesting to read about and probably my favourite protagonist of any of Shakespeare's works (along with the ever-awesome Rosalind of As You Like It). I can see why his speeches are legendary, and spotting all of his famous quotes was great fun. One thing I did feel slightly disappointed with was Ophelia's role in the play, as I've heard a lot about her being one of Shakespeare's great female leads. Although I do think she is an interesting character, she didn't add much (if anything) to the story in my opinion and I found hardly any of the wit or strength in her that I've been hearing about. I found the ending of this play to be not necessarily disappointing, but I think it could have been done better. It's not that I feel that the deaths of almost all of the main characters shouldn't have happened, but really, Laertes and Hamlet somehow switching swords in their battle so that they both could get stabbed by the poisoned sword? That felt a bit of a silly way to get them both to die, I have to admit. Still, I liked the way Hamlet killed Claudius - I'm sure that would be an epic scene on the stage. The only death that really disappointed me was Gertrude's. Going by the big part she played in Hamlet's motivations for revenge, I expected more in the end than for her to just die by accident. Yes, it was a cool way for the poisoned drink to be involved in the concluding events of the play, but it told us nothing about her character and what she was thinking at the time. If she had just drank the cup willingly after she saw her son kill her husband then die himself, surely that would have been better? Overall, there were a couple of things that I think might have been improved within Hamlet, but it really was a great read. There were many, many things I loved, including but not limited to; the play-within-a-play (The Murder of Gonzago), the amusing way that the courtiers kept sucking up to Claudius, and the recurring themes of revenge, family (particularly how Claudius was Hamlet's 'dad-uncle') and what happens after death.

255,"I moved through this one slowly because the story is told through footnotes on a poem. Lots of flipping back & forth, lots of poetic turns of phrase to sink your teeth into. I went in with trepidation, but enjoyed it a lot. Despite the high degree of ""metafiction-ness"" it's still a compelling story with more than a little humor. And even...slapstick? Who knew? I get the feeling that Nabokov is the kind of guy who loves to lead readers on merry snipe hunts, especially the detail-oriented ones who go in searching for symbols and hidden meaning and authorial intent (as if there is one correct answer) and he mocks that with the poem and footnotes here. Some of the best humor stems from the footnoter completely missing the point of what he's supposed to be commenting on, or going off on random tangents all his own. It's pretty great. And then there's the question of ""what really happened"" with regards to a murder and a deposed king and mistaken identities. I bet there isn't a right answer, and that Nabokov loved to mislead all the merry hunter/readers in his interviews on this one, just for kicks.

257,"When I saw this available on NetGalley, I was surprised because I hadn't heard that Nicholson Baker had a new novel coming out. It took just a few pages before I realized what this is! A sequel to The Anthologist, a book I loved and got me into reading poetry again, with one of my favorite characters lately. I was happy to jump into his mind again. This is Paul Chowder, sitting in a plastic chair. I want-I want-I want to tell you something new. I feel that I have a new thing. Now I will put the rest of the review behind spoiler tags because my friend who first recommended Baker to me will lose it if I give anything away before he gets to read it! I think you could get the wrong impression about Baker if you only read his Paul Chowder books. Paul is an older, creative, kind, slightly bumbling man living in his own little world of poems, plastic chairs, and ex-girlfriends. There was a lot to love about his life a few years after The Anthologist. His commentary on music, his attempts to keep writing poetry and music, his Quaker meetings... all just brought a stupid silly grin to my face because I love him so much. This is not the same critical/judgey Baker from Double Fold: Libraries and the Assault on Paper or push-the-limits-of-erotic-language Baker of House of Holes (although he does waggle his Shropshire lad one night, a little shout out maybe). I like that he can be so many different things, and that his books aren't all the same. I never know what to expect, even when revisiting a character from a previous book. When I read The Anthologist, I was inspired to create an index for the poetry mentioned. I bet this book will drive me to make a playlist of the music mentioned, but I don't want to do so until it comes out officially (check back in September when the book officially releases, and I will be buying myself a copy!). His span of music from pop to classical had me looking songs up left and right, some I knew and wanted to hear through Paul Chowder's eyes, and some I had never heard of before. Here is where I throw the quotations I loved into a list until I figure out what to say about them. I marked a lot of this book and I already want to return to it. They are from the ARC and may be different in the final version. ""Early this morning I had a literary dream."" ""My knees are laughing. Is that allowed?"" ""I drove back to Portsmouth, up Route 95, with my tires going around and around saying the same things to the road over and over again. The road never gets it, never learns."" ""I don't know anything useful about poetry anymore. I love it, sort of, but I also don't love it and don't understand it, and every day I live, it seems more mysterious and farther away from me."" ""I want to really be with a woman. By that I mean I want to be able to stay up late with her talking about everything. I want to show her all the things that I've found out, which aren't very interesting maybe, but they're what I have. And I want her to show me all the things that she's found out."" ""I want to confide....I could listen to her say things forever."" ""Sexual laughter."" ""My very own talker, my slipper and slapper of mysteries."" ""Sometimes you don't want to know about evil, you just want to know about love. You want to take off the misery hat and think only about the good things."" [This comes from the Fearing song listed below! And not cited! But it comes out of Paul's head, his memory.] ""Almost messages"" <- Quaker term ""Don't expect people to hate one another. Wait and see what happens."" ""She's a namer of unnameables... She was full of this quality that I've come to take seriously, which is lovingkindness."" ""Tracy Chapman puts me through a moral Simpactor, breaking me into tiny pieces of uniform diameter so that I can absorb my own inadequacy."" ""What the hell. Make some music in the wreckage."" ""That's what happens when you write down a sentence, or a stanza. When you think of it, you imagine it in all its fleshed-out, full-voiced spoken plenitude.

The little vagina in the throat clenches, and air comes pushing up through it, and oooh! There it goes, up into the mouth, where it's manipulated by the lips and tongue.. So it comes into being as an audible phrase, as a living heavy healthy plump fleshy thing."" ""You have to be careful not to overlisten to a piece of music you love, or you'll wear it out - it has to last your whole life.

258,"This book completely caught me off guard. To be honest, I would not have picked it up, and actually would have shied away from it, because of the basketball player on the cover. I love mid grade, but I didn't think I would have liked a mid grade book about boys who play basketball. But I read it because I am determined to read all of the Newbery Medal winners (and this is the 2015 winner). I was blown away. Poetic and rhythmic, Alexander brings a beauty and musicality to this story. This book was a huge surprise to me in the best way: the author wrapped me up and sucked me in.

259,"I really enjoyed this book (a collection of short stories, poems and short pieces). When I starting reading this, I was tired so I went through the first story and all the short pieces first before going back to the other short stories and I think I missed connections or juxtapositions so I'm going to reread it. I was reading this as a ""Buddy Read"" in my Goodreads group and one of the discussion questions was around whether he's representative or can be seen as a voice for Native Americans. I think there is an aspect to that in his writing but also, he's writing interesting, thought-provoking stuff and not always ""about"" Native Americans. I like the specificity of Sherman Alexie's writing; there are certain themes he comes back to but he's testing them in different situations and they seem to come from a very personal place so I think that he's balanced that well. After finishing the book, I Googled for more about it and found a reading plus Q&A he did in Philadelphia for the book, which touches on some of these ideas (link below). I don't know if I necessarily agree with everything he's talking about but I did like the discussion and I think most of the Q&A is worth a listen (the readings too). http://libwww.freelibrary.org/authore... I also really enjoyed the different structures he used in his pieces. My favourite piece and a great example was the 15th section of ""War Dances"", the title piece. The section was called ""Exit Interview For My Father"" and starts with a list of questions to his dad  that includes questions like ""Your son has often made the joke that you were the only Indian of your generation who went to Catholic school on purpose. This is, of course, a tasteless joke that makes light of the forced incarceration and subsequent physical, spiritual, cultural, and sexual abuse of tens of thousands of Native American children in Catholic and Protestant boarding schools. In consideration of your son's questionable judgment in telling jokes, do you think there should be any moral limits placed on comedy?"" The section then continues with a poem the main character wrote about his dad and then a rebuttal of sorts pointing out the actual facts of the incident that the poem was meant to be about and just general points about life.",5,poetry,"['enjoy', 'book', 'collection_short', 'story', 'poem', 'short', 'piece', 'start', 'read', 'tired', 'go', 'story', 'short', 'piece', 'go', 'short_story', 'think', 'miss', 'connection', 'juxtaposition', 'go', 'reread', 'read', 'buddy', 'read', 'goodreads', 'group', 'discussion', 'question', 'representative', 'see', 'voice', 'native', 'americans', 'think', 'aspect', 'writing', 'write', 'interesting', 'thought_provoke', 'stuff', 'native', 'americans', 'like', 'specificity', 'sherman', 'alexie', 'writing', 'certain', 'theme', 'come', 'test', 'different', 'situation', 'come', 'personal', 'place', 'think', 'balance', 'finish', 'book', 'google', 'find', 'reading', 'plus', 'philadelphia', 'book', 'touch', 'idea', 'link', 'know', 'necessarily', 'agree', 'talk', 'like', 'discussion', 'think', 'worth', 'listen', 'reading', 'enjoy', 'different', 'structure', 'piece', 'favourite', 'piece', 'great', 'example', 'section', 'war', 'dance', 'title', 'piece', 'section', 'call', 'exit', 'interview', 'father', 'start', 'list', 'question', 'dad', 'include', 'question', 'like', 'son', 'joke', 'indian', 'generation', 'go', 'catholic', 'school', 'purpose', 'course', 'tasteless', 'joke', 'make', 'light', 'force', 'incarceration', 'subsequent', 'physical', 'spiritual', 'cultural', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'ten', 'thousand', 'native', 'american', 'child', 'catholic', 'protestant', 'boarding', 'school', 'consideration', 'son', 'questionable', 'judgment', 'tell', 'joke', 'think', 'moral', 'limit', 'place', 'comedy', 'section', 'continue', 'poem', 'main_character', 'write', 'dad', 'rebuttal', 'sort', 'point', 'actual', 'fact', 'incident', 'poem', 'mean', 'general', 'point', 'life']"

262,"First thing I thought, ""If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it."" but that doesn't quite fit. To be quite honest, I couldn't get over the feeling that there was something seriously missing in translation. I've read that Pushkin is amazing in the original Russian, but in this English translation I was left almost completely cold. There were moments when the verse really sparkled and I was amazed, but not because of the poetry but because what he was saying rang true to me [and no, I'm not talking about the foot fetish, I'm talking about how he would kind of like to be remembered for his work when he's gone, since I'm having those kinds of doubts myself]. The poetry itself was rather... I don't know, I was just not as impressed as I was reading The Faerie Queene: Book One. Spenser, however, was a native English speaker, so his verse is naturally more clever. It was certainly an enjoyable diversion, though, and that's what counts.

263,"It's been a while since I read a volume of poetry. Lullabies was a quick read. I have to be honest, this book felt a bit like a teen alternately waxing ecstatic over a romanticized version of perfect love or angsting over love lost. There was nothing wrong with the poems, but they were meh. There were a few that stood out as better than others. I found myself preferring the freeform segments, that felt less like poetry and more like an extemporaneous thought process captured on paper. My favorites include: Patience - Patience and Love are personified and searching for one another in an olive orchard. As typical, once Patience gives up the search, Love finds her. In similar fashion, I also liked Three Questions - it Gratitude, Joy, and Sorrow asking questions: ""What was it like to love him?"" ""What was it like to be loved in return?"" and ""What was it like to lose him."" The conclusion, ""It was like hearing every goodbye ever said to me - said all at once."" captured a great bit of emotion. I also really liked Pretext - it is short and succinct; Our love -- a dead star to the world it burns brightly -- But it died long ago. Two Fisherman - this to me captured two types of males that plaque women throughout time: one who wants all women, but none to keep and the other is seeking one ideal fish, so no other holds his interest.

I'm still not a fan of that style of writing though and I'm not sure why it was necessary? But at least it moved quickly! At first Nicu's chapters with the poor English were annoying to read, but I soon grew used to it. Interesting story too and both he and Jess had interesting tales to tell. I liked seeing Jess grow up a bit too. I didn't like how it ended - with Nicu tricking Jess into getting on the train without him...I mean what's next? It was such a non-ending!

I think that he's clever and interesting and funny, and if you haven't realized how seriously I am crushing on this guy than you need to read more books. Lolita is a masterpiece, and no matter my love for Nabokov, he will have a difficult time convincing me that that book is not his best work (although I will keep looking). Pale Fire is an interesting book, because it's a poem, but no really, it's the story behind the poem told by a guy who might or might not be the King Zembla, or just some insane guy who bamboozled John Shade's wife into allowing him to publish Shade's poem, that really matters here. In the end, though, Kinbote is a lonely guy who was in love with his neighbor who died, and then after his death, used his fame as a way to elevate his own status in the world .

266,"The good: I love this translation. Robert Fagels is amazing and really wonderfully revives an ancient text, making it vibrant on the page. The bad: I kind of hate Odysseus and Telemachus, making it nearly impossible to take satisfaction in most of the events of the tale. I don't remember hating them this much when I first read it, but then I was twelve and had different ideas about the world and how it should work. I mean, honestly. My notes on the final four books went like this (I'm using spoilers even though this has been out for a really long time. Just in case): Eumaeus kills Ctesippus and then shouts taunts over his dead body. Awesome. Odysseus makes the women who have ""shamed"" the household clear away the bodies of their lovers and clean up the hall before taking them outside to murder them. Classy, Odysseus. Telemachus makes it even more classy by refusing them a ""clean death"" and hanging them instead. This is a charming family. Penelope takes for fucking ever to believe that Odysseus is actually home. Sigh. Penelope suggests moving the bed, and this suggestion makes Odysseus furious because apparently it calls into question his manhood or something. He built the bed out of an olive tree still rooted to the ground, and it takes the supposedly-clever man far too long to realize that this is Penelope's test for him, when he probably should have realized that all along instead of flying off the handle. When the suitors get to the Underworld, the ghosts are all gossiping about the drama happening up top. Odysseus weeps when he sees his father for the first time. For some reason Odysseus still decides it's better to test his father and ""reproach him with words that cut him to the core"" instead of offering comfort to the man who has been broken by his son's absence. I really do not like Odysseus. Antinous's father rouses the people to seek revenge on Odysseus - and, really, who can blame him? ""He lost the shops and he lost the men and back he comes again to kill the best of our Cephallenian princes."" That about sums it up. Athena holds Odysseus back, stops the fight, and hands down the pacts of peace for both sides... ...which seems particularly unsatisfying for the families of all those who were killed. Which is not to knock the text and imply that nothing can be learned from it.

Virgil is said to be ""subversive"" because he provides a one-line clue that he knows perfectly well that he is composing myth (the hero leaves through the 'gate of lies' from hell. second, the Dido-Aeneas affair only in the 19th century became an issue of contention. before this time, there is no record that any civilization or period questioned Aeneas's rejection of love for duty/ national foundation. questioning this decision is a modern conceit.",4,poetry,"['foundational', 'epic', 'roman', 'empire', 'pretty', 'good', 'adventure', 'fable', 'need', 'annotate', 'version', 'story', 'strong', 'homer', 'odyssey', 'iliad', 'clearly', 'aeneid', 'flowing', 'part', 'helpful', 'understand', 'roman', 'view', 'world', 'empire', 'quick', 'guide', 'understand', 'work', 'story', 'arm', 'man', 'warfare', 'personality', 'mythical', 'founder', 'rome', 'aeneas', 'virgil', 'say', 'subversive', 'provide', 'line', 'clue', 'know', 'perfectly', 'compose', 'myth', 'hero', 'leave', 'gate', 'lie', 'hell', 'second', 'dido', 'aeneas', 'affair', 'century', 'issue', 'contention', 'time', 'record', 'civilization', 'period', 'question', 'aeneas', 'rejection', 'love', 'national', 'foundation', 'question', 'decision', 'modern', 'conceit']"

Her mother was trash, I hated her mother so much that when the father came back into the picture I wanted Kasienka to wake up and live with her father. I mean I understand the mother's situation but the way she took it, the lengths she went through, it was all at the expense of her daughter. Towards the end of the book she didn't even deserves Kasienka's love. I'm really glad that William didn't turn out to be trash like almost everyone else in Kasienka's life. Long story short, this book made me angry with how unfair it was and her mother's a blind mule like Kasienka's mother said.",4,poetry,"['book', 'pretty', 'good', 'writing', 'spectacular', 'give', 'book', 'star', 'extremely', 'realistic', 'way', 'kasienka', 'handle', 'thing', 'sadly', 'way', 'book', 'handle', 'kasienka', 'reason', 'stick', 'book', 'long', 'want', 'happy', 'desperately', 'disgust', 'mother', 'trash', 'hate', 'mother', 'father', 'come', 'picture', 'want', 'kasienka', 'wake', 'live', 'father', 'mean', 'understand', 'mother', 'situation', 'way', 'take', 'length', 'go', 'expense', 'daughter', 'end', 'book', 'deserve', 'kasienka', 'love', 'glad', 'william', 'turn', 'trash', 'like', 'kasienka', 'life', 'long', 'story', 'short', 'book', 'angry', 'unfair', 'mother', 'blind', 'mule', 'like', 'kasienka', 'mother', 'say']"
271,"Wow! I was a fan of Nabokov's prose thanks to Lolita but that book has nothing on this one. Pale Fire is many-layered, many-framed and at times makes my head spin. I wanted to knock off a few points for some incomprensible passages, but I finally decided that's a fault of mine and not of Nabokov's. Pale Fire starts with a long, long poem that takes almost 1/3 of the entire book. From the advice of another reader, I skipped the poem and dived right into the meat of the actual story, which is commentary on the poem. Now, one can say that reading a commentary of a 1000-line poem sounds boring and I would even say that if I hadn't just read this book, but trust me, it's awesome. Nabokov's prose is so lyrical, so wonderful, so funny sometimes that it makes me turn green with envy. For example, this part, where the narrator was complaining about being invited to a dinner party where his hosts knew in advance of his vegetarian eating habits but still tried to serve him meat: ""I revanched myself rather neatly. Of a dozen or so invitations that I extended, the Shades accepted just three. Every one of these meals was built around some vegetable that I subjected to as many exquisite metamorphoses as Parmentier had his pet tuber undergo."" How can one not fall in love with such a masterful command of language? Pale Fire is certainly a book that requires a dictionary or even an encyclopedia to fully enjoy. It's hard work to read through, but it is so, so worth it. And the double entendres overflow this book if you're into that sort of thing! What Nabokov excels at most is his descriptions of people and their situations. Take this one for example: ""One finds it hard to decide what Gradus alias Grey wanted more at that minute: discharge his gun or rid himself of the inexhaustible lava in his bowels."" How can diarrhea sound so good? Because it comes out of Nabokov's pen. Pale Fire blew my mind on several levels, but one of the biggest explosions in my mind came at the end when our narrator realizes that the poem he wanted so much to be about Zembla actually isn't. He ends up crestfallen that his beautiful country won't be immortalized on paper through this poem. But the mind-blowing part is that it actually ends up being immortalized on paper through his commentary on the poem. It blew my mind in the same way that I Love Lucy is a successful television show about a woman who tries unsuccessfully to break into show-biz. So meta! A spoilered discussion of the plot follows. If you haven't read the book but are thinking about it, please, please don't read the spoiler. It will tarnish the experience of reading it for the first time. It becomes obvious early on that Charles Kinbote is the often-mentioned escaped ex-King of Zembla. Even before he starts hinting at it, an astute reader can easily figure it out. How else would someone know such fine details of the king's life? Although I had fairly solid suspicion this was the case early in, what really sealed the deal was Kinbote's comment about being a vegetarian himself. Even before I suspected Kinbote as being the king, I suspected he was in love with Shade. I think this suspicion grew in parallel with my suspicion that he was gay, which probably led me to the suspicion of him being the King. It's too coincidental to have two flamboyantly gay characters in a Nabokov novel, no?",5,poetry,"['wow', 'fan', 'nabokov', 'prose', 'thank', 'lolita', 'book', 'pale_fire', 'layered', 'framed', 'time', 'make', 'head', 'spin', 'want', 'knock', 'point', 'incomprensible', 'passage', 'finally', 'decide', 'fault', 'nabokov', 'pale_fire', 'start', 'long', 'long', 'poem', 'take', 'entire', 'book', 'advice', 'reader', 'skip', 'poem', 'dive', 'right', 'meat', 'actual', 'story', 'commentary', 'poem', 'read', 'commentary', 'line', 'poem', 'sound', 'boring', 'read', 'book', 'trust', 'awesome', 'nabokov', 'prose', 'lyrical', 'wonderful', 'funny', 'make', 'turn', 'green', 'envy', 'example', 'narrator', 'complain', 'invite', 'dinner', 'party', 'host', 'know', 'advance', 'vegetarian', 'eating', 'habit', 'try', 'serve', 'meat', 'revanche', 'neatly', 'dozen', 'invitation', 'extend', 'shades', 'accept', 'meal', 'build', 'vegetable', 'subject', 'exquisite', 'metamorphosis', 'parmentier', 'pet', 'tuber', 'undergo', 'fall_love', 'masterful', 'command', 'language', 'pale_fire', 'certainly', 'book', 'require', 'dictionary', 'encyclopedia', 'fully', 'enjoy', 'hard', 'work', 'read', 'worth', 'double', 'entendre', 'overflow', 'book', 'sort', 'thing', 'nabokov', 'excel', 'description', 'people', 'situation', 'example', 'find', 'hard', 'decide', 'gradus', 'alias', 'grey', 'want', 'minute', 'discharge', 'gun', 'rid', 'inexhaustible', 'lava', 'bowel', 'diarrhea', 'sound', 'good', 'come', 'nabokov', 'pen', 'pale_fire', 'blow_mind', 'level', 'big', 'explosion', 'mind', 'come', 'end', 'narrator', 'realize', 'poem', 'want', 'zembla', 'actually', 'end', 'crestfallen', 'beautiful', 'country', 'will', 'immortalize', 'paper', 'poem', 'mind_blow', 'actually', 'end', 'immortalize', 'paper', 'commentary', 'poem', 'blow_mind', 'way', 'love', 'lucy', 'successful', 'television', 'woman', 'try', 'unsuccessfully', 'break', 'biz', 'meta', 'spoilered', 'discussion', 'plot', 'follow', 'read', 'book', 'think', 'read', 'spoiler', 'tarnish', 'experience', 'read', 'time', 'obvious', 'early', 'charles', 'kinbote', 'mention', 'escape', 'ex', 'king', 'zembla', 'start', 'hint', 'astute', 'reader', 'easily', 'figure', 'know', 'fine', 'detail', 'king', 'life', 'fairly', 'solid', 'suspicion', 'case', 'early', 'seal', 'deal', 'kinbote', 'comment', 'vegetarian', 'suspect', 'kinbote', 'king', 'suspect', 'love', 'shade', 'think', 'suspicion', 'grow', 'parallel', 'suspicion', 'gay', 'probably', 'lead', 'suspicion', 'king', 'coincidental', 'flamboyantly', 'gay', 'character', 'nabokov', 'novel']"

273,"Many say that this is nothing more than an overrated, incomprehensible bunch of words about sex, alcohol and drugs. And they are right. But poetry is not about words, it's about the feeling they are capable of evoke. And Howl evoke a lot of feelings, at least for me. The eternal search of the meaning of life, the conflicted relation between the fear and mystification of death, the wonders and terrors of growing old. ""I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked, [...] who threw their watches off the roof to cast their ballot for Eternity outside of Time, & alarm clocks fell on their heads every day for the next decade, who cut their wrists three times successively unsuccessfully, gave up and were forced to open antique stores where they thought they were growing old and cried, who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse & the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments of fashion & the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertising & the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality.""

274,"This was kind of a mess... I had many issues with this book, it all started with the first 'huge secret/reveal/plot twist', it's so bad, I still can't imagine how someone would do that and why? Audrey, the protagonist, starts telling us all about a lie that she had told her friends, a lie she had never expected to blow up or impact anyone's life. Actually, she imagined she would be able to tell her friends years from then that it was all a lie. Nothing real. And that lie was that a girl they all knew, Ana, was having sex with her father. Yap, you read that clearly enough. How can you believe that saying such a lie would impact no one? Then it gets a million times worse, the love interest is presented and we have a serious case of emotional cheating and then physical cheating too. I could understand what she meant when she said it was hard for her to break-up with her longtime, since-childhood boyfriend, but still it took her so long. Also, her love interest is the ex-boyfriend of the girl who commited suicide because of the lie she told. And she has little to no guilt when it comes to it. I hated how the only characters who seemed to have depth were Audrey and Rad and the others were one dimensional, even though at some point I would have preferred to read about anyone else. I would have liked this book a lot more if it didn't feel like it's trying to soften its characthers' mistakes, like I could do just well with a morally grey character that admits to it. But Audrey feels sorry for herself all the time and is whiny about it and likes to think that she's better than anyone else and just ugh. Also, her boyfriend, Rad (ex-boyfriend of Ana, the 'dead girl') killed Ana by accident and then staged a suicide. He was forgiven by Audrey, however, and they ended up together, being the power couple, yikes. The only characters I liked were Lucy and Freddy and as expected they didn't end up well.

275,"I grieve that I must give the Bard a mediocre rating for a play rich in critique of justice and thick with dramatic tension [I believe it was act II or III whose final scene made me go ""WHOAAAAAAAAAAA""] but there are more problems with this Problem Play than just categorizing it as a comedy or a tragedy [or even a ""romance"" as I've sometimes seen, would not accurately describe this play]. I mean, after the mid-way point, the play starts to fall apart a bit; perhaps a trend with Shakespeare, as I felt the same way about Richard III. And Act V's ""big reveal"" of the Duke sentencing everyone to scare them and then marrying them off instead [except maybe Comic Relief Man Lucio who may be getting married and then executed? I wasn't too clear on that.] did not come off quite as well as it could have. I found it unbelievable that the Provost, who was in cahoots with the Duke/Friar throughout, would not have instantly revealed Claudio's still being alive at the threat of losing his job... And where does the Duke get off wanting to marry a woman who has been all about becoming a nun from Act I? BUT, problems aside, the poetry is (as always) beautiful, the sex jokes amusing, and as I said before Measure For Measure can be a real thriller up to about Act V.

277,"DNF @ 20% I'm not going to give this book a rating, simply because I didn't read that much of it, but I truly cannot bring myself to read more than I already have. In the 70 or so pages I read, there were some things that I didn't click with: - So much  telling  . Page after page of telling instead of showing things that happened, which made it difficult for me to get into the story. - Insta love . Normally, I'm willing to give it a chance, but here it was just too  insta  for me. Because everything was  telling  I really didn't understand how they could feel something for each other, which led to me not caring about their friendship/relationship at all. -This is I guess a personal issue, but one all the same. I couldn't connect to any of the characters, especially Audrey. They all come off as spoiled rich kids with substance abuse problems and bad parents. I couldn't bring myself to care about them. -The way it was written. When it wasn't long-winded paragraphs, it was stilted dialogue. I didn't see an ounce of personality in these people's conversations. Here's an example: ""So how long have you been together?"" ""Since we were kids, basically. But we have literally nothing in common."" ""No?"" I shook my head. ""We disagree on just about everything. I can never play my music out loud around him. And he's not really into books. But I suppose they say opposites attract."" ""He doesn't read books?"" said Rad. ""No. Well, actually, there's a book he's reading at the moment. I think it's called Yes - Now What's the Next Question?"" Isn't that a self-help book?"" ""Yeah, something like that."" ""I suppose you prefer fiction?"" I nodded. ""Definitely."" ""What's your favorite book?"" I thought for a moment. "" The Land of Laughs,  I think."" ""That's a good one."" ... and it was like that the whole time I was reading. I did like the exploration of panic attacks, and the way they were described. There was also hints at a f/f romance, but that wasn't enough to keep me motivated to go on, sadly. In the end, this may have been more of a ""me"" problem, because there are a lot of people who really liked this.

278,"2.5 stars Let's just start with I agree with all of the overall themes book gave out, and perhaps because I'm prone being picky when it comes to how sentimentally ""deep"" a book is, this book was not for me. I love poetry, and perhaps this book is nice and fresh for some, but this felt like beginner's level poetry for me. I did however LOVE the illustrations in this book, and if they were a separate book I would have given them five stars alone. To me, most of these poems were just a collection of scattered words and random metaphors. The pattern of the few poems I did enjoy were a bit longer than the rest of the poem, and I realize if Kaur had developed some of her messages I might have actually enjoyed more of her poems. I really appreciated the messages Kaur attempted to spread, but when a poem had six words, and three word breaks, it just felt more in the format of a poem rather than being an actual poem. There were some poems like: ""you are your own soul mate."" Again, great message, but if I knew this is the poetry that has been such highly praised, I would not have picked up this book in the first place. And then rare poems like this, which was probably my most enjoyed poem (If only the novel included more of these): ""you tell me i am not like most girls and learn to kiss me with your eyes closed something about the phrase--something about how i have to be unlike the women i call sisters in order to be wanted makes me want to spit your tongue out like i am supposed to be proud you picked me as if i should be relieved you think i am better than them"" The message of this one was not only so clearly conveyed, but it was well developed, unlike many of the other poems. ""but for some overrated poetry there is bound to be unpopular opinions and maybe because i have them it makes me different from the rest but in all fairness i will not apologize for being different"" -- me Huh, maybe I should write a poetry book. *also wanted to add something to this review. I've read many comments saying that this book doesn't deserve a low rating because the author poured her raw feelings into this book, and so it shouldn't be judged. Most authors do that.

279,"Hamlet is, perhaps, the most tragic and dramatic literature character ever created. Well, arguably, since other authors such as Dostoyevsky always clung on absolute tragedy, turmoil and disaster for their characters, but you catch my drift. There are so many things to say about Hamlet, and yet I can't seem to find the correct words to define him. He's somewhat reckless and yet cautious, courteous and yet impolite, tender but barbaric. He grieves his father's demise with absolute despair and abjection, and yet when he's responsible (directly or indirectly) for someone's demise e.g. Guildernstern's, Polonius' , he shows no remorse at all, let alone any feelings. Hamlet is so kind hearted, and yet he's such a flawed man. Not that a flawed person cannot be great, but Hamlet is just something else. He's vicious, reckless, barbaric, hateful and yet he's still able to be our tragic hero. Why? His father's death changed him, that's for sure. Perhaps he turned hateful and barbaric because the obliviousness of his father's death, the fact he didn't know enough, drove him insane. Perhaps his heart was heavy from sorrow because of his father but didn't feel remorse for others precisely because his father's demise made him lose sense of himself, of life and everyone else. I believe on the first act, part II, Hamlet describes how great his father was; loving towards his (Hamlet's) mother, a formidable king, a great man. His description of him shows how sorrowful his remembrance of his father is; he basically forges a godlike image of him. Did he really love his father that much, that honestly, or did his death and the enigma of his demise simply affect him to the point of canonising him? Not being completely certain and speculating about it is what gives beauty to this play, not only because of the opaque feelings Hamlet has towards his father, but because the entire play itself is an enigma. Characters such as Polonius (self-absorbed and hypocritical), Horatio (sceptical and intelligent, but warm and caring) and Ophelia (gullible and foolish) are all complex characters that give you too much to think about. Horatio is my favourite character from the play, because of his kind heart and good humour, he reminds me a lot of Dostoyevsky's ""Dmitri Razumikhim"" from ""Crime and Punishment"". I just love the depth and ambiguity of the personages. This play is profound despite not being very long; not only does it contain a rich extension of the English language, but the characters of the play itself are quite interested in the language themselves. I've never been a fan of Shakespeare, I have always respected him as a good poet and master of words (in my own subjective way) and that's about it, but I do give him the credit for Hamlet; it is a beautiful, profound and colossal piece of work.

280,"*Pick it for me freebie reads #14. Thanks for voting* See this review and more on my blog Lilybloombooks 1.5 stars Honestly, I don't even know where to start with this book. Due to the fact that the few books I read before this one were awesome, I was hoping I would continue on my ""Good Book Roll"". Sadly, that is not the case. Falling for the Ghost of You could have been a great book, hell--even good, honest. But there are several different reasons why this it wasn't and just didn't work for me. The only thing going for it was its humor. There were parts that I legit laughed my butt off. The rest? No. I'll start with the writing. It had this weird.. vibe to it (I'm really at a loss for words how to describe it). Like I was reading this girls diary vs living out the events with her. Considering that this wasn't the intention, it didn't work. It's very bland and underdeveloped. It was choppy and lacked even a decent flow-- it was just all over the place. To put it straight, it felt like the VERY first draft. Not only was I laughing at the funny parts, I was also laughing at the unbelievably ridiculous things that came about randomly and others that left a bad taste in my mouth. Violet being a best-selling author (to pay for her Mom's medical bills) and her,""Yeah, no big deal I'm just a bad ass"" attitude. The whole situation with her best friend and the relationship with her teacher. This isn't something to just say, ""oh shit"" about a brush off. Nor is it in good taste to have her end up pregnant with all the nonchalance in the world. That is serious shit right there, people. . The fact that Zane's ""secret"" was so unrealistic. He is supposedly this very famous singer/actor. You are telling me that just changing hair color and contacts would keep the media in the dark? How about the fact that he was her FAVORITE singer and she didn't KNOW!? C'mon, now. Could you BE more dense? The plot holes were so big it was unreal. Violet is probably one of my least favorite protagonist, ever. For one, she is very immature and judgemental. Everyone was a slut, or a ho or a whore. Let me take a minute to point out that the one person that could be considered a ""slut"", was Zane. For the first week she stayed with him, he had a different girl/woman over every night. Did this thought cross her mind? Nope. I guess a ""hot body"" gives him a pass. She was a horrible friend. Sure, she gave her a car at the end but what about all that drama in between? She was so selfish and obsessed with her ""relationship"" with Zane, she couldn't see what was happening with her best friend. Speaking of; the ""romance"" was boring. I will admit, I did kind of  like their banter in the beginning (VERY beginning) but once the feelings came into play, I just couldn't give a rats ass. It's always hard for me to believe that a guy that has a different woman over every night just gives that up for the girl. (Especially Violet). Did those women not know who he was, either?! I mean, let's be real here. The ending was... sad. Not boo-hoo sad, but ""I didn't think things could possible get worse"" sad. My eyes were hurting from all the rolling. Honestly, I could go on and on about all the reasons why this book didn't work and all the things that were NOT OKAY. But I wont. My Peeve~ I'm sure you could guess, but if not... pretty much the whole thing. The only reason why I didn't mark as DNF is because I needed a good laugh. Overall~ I didn't like it. I wish I hadn't put this one on the poll and damn sure wish I hadn't ""purchased"" it. Thank goodness it was free. Sure, I was entertained by the humor and ridiculousness but this just proves that-- Some books are great; some books are good.. and some books are... not.",1,romance,"['pick', 'freebie', 'read', 'thank', 'voting', 'review', 'blog', 'lilybloombooks', 'star', 'honestly', 'know', 'start', 'book', 'fact', 'book', 'read', 'awesome', 'hope', 'continue', 'good', 'book', 'roll', 'sadly', 'case', 'fall', 'ghost', 'great', 'book', 'hell', 'good', 'honest', 'different', 'reason', 'work', 'thing', 'go', 'humor', 'part', 'legit', 'laugh', 'butt', 'rest', 'start', 'writing', 'weird', 'vibe', 'loss', 'word_describe', 'like', 'read', 'girls', 'diary', 'vs', 'live', 'event', 'consider', 'intention', 'work', 'bland', 'underdeveloped', 'choppy', 'lack', 'decent', 'place', 'straight', 'feel', 'like', 'draft', 'laugh', 'funny', 'part', 'laugh', 'unbelievably', 'ridiculous', 'thing', 'come', 'randomly', 'leave', 'bad', 'taste', 'mouth', 'violet', 'well', 'sell', 'author', 'pay', 'mom', 'medical', 'bill', 'big', 'deal', 'bad', 'ass', 'attitude', 'situation', 'good', 'friend', 'relationship', 'teacher', 'oh', 'shit', 'brush', 'good', 'taste', 'end', 'pregnant', 'nonchalance', 'world', 'shit', 'right', 'people', 'fact', 'zane', 'secret', 'unrealistic', 'supposedly', 'famous', 'singer', 'actor', 'tell', 'change', 'hair', 'color', 'contact', 'medium', 'dark', 'fact', 'favorite', 'singer', 'know', 'dense', 'plot_hole', 'big', 'unreal', 'violet', 'probably_favorite', 'protagonist', 'immature', 'judgemental', 'slut', 'ho', 'whore', 'let', 'minute', 'point', 'person', 'consider', 'slut', 'zane', 'week', 'stay', 'different', 'girl', 'woman', 'night', 'thought', 'cross', 'mind', 'nope', 'guess', 'hot', 'body', 'give', 'pass', 'horrible', 'friend', 'sure', 'give', 'car', 'end', 'drama', 'selfish', 'obsess', 'relationship', 'zane', 'happen', 'good', 'friend', 'speak', 'romance', 'boring', 'admit', 'kind', 'like', 'banter', 'beginning', 'beginning', 'feeling', 'come', 'play', 'rat', 'ass', 'hard', 'believe', 'guy', 'different', 'woman', 'night', 'give', 'girl', 'especially', 'violet', 'woman', 'know', 'mean', 'let', 'real', 'ending', 'sad', 'boo', 'hoo', 'sad', 'think', 'thing', 'possible', 'bad', 'sad', 'eye', 'hurt', 'rolling', 'honestly', 'reason', 'book', 'work', 'thing', 'okay', 'will', 'nt', 'sure', 'guess', 'pretty', 'thing', 'reason', 'mark', 'dnf', 'need', 'good', 'laugh', 'like', 'wish', 'poll', 'damn', 'sure', 'wish', 'purchase', 'thank', 'goodness', 'free', 'sure', 'entertain', 'humor', 'ridiculousness', 'prove', 'book', 'great', 'book', 'good', 'book']"

283,"So, I have really mixed feelings about this book. On one hand, it was a worthy sequel in my opinion. But on the other hand, I'd hoped for things to be different for Lara Jean. (I think.) There were some lines in the book that were beautiful and right on point though, and this one just moved me. There's a Korean word my grandma taught me. It's called jung. It's the connection between two people that can't be severed, even when love turns to hate. You still have those old feelings for them; you can't ever completely shake them loose of you; you will always have tenderness in your heart for them. It was a good book. And I liked it. I just wish we'd gotten more. More of Chris. More of Margot. More of Josh. Well, we can never get enough of Kitty. She's my favourite character in the book. Also, I really hoped that Lara Jean wouldn't end up with Peter. Like how we have some perfect relationships and we just move on? I wanted to see that, I guess. But we got that with Margot and Josh, so maybe not. Also, it probably didn't help that I was rooting for John Ambrose. It was sad to see that he was reduced to side character. I'd really hoped there would be more story given there. But also, I loved Jenny Han handled Lara Jean's friendship with Genevieve. That was beautiful and so real. How some might never be friends again. So all in all, I would recommend everyone to check out both of these books because they're great and well-written, and also because of Kitty. She's amazing.

284,"This was a cute contemporary romance. I loved the setting in Paris. I liked the characters for the most part. I was not a fan of St. Clair being a cheating boyfriend and Anna being okay with that. I get that she was trying to not like him for several reasons, the obvious one being that he has a girlfriend. Her friend also liked him. But I like my characters to have flaws, so this didn't take away from the story for me. Anna's reasons for forgiving her best friend were kind of weak, in my opinion. I think forgiving her because they've been friends for so long would have attested to the strength of their friendship more. Her forgiveness was more ""well I couldn't help myself with St. Clair even though he had a girlfriend, so now I get that she couldn't help herself with this boy I like back home. Forgiven!"" That was kind of weird. I think I would have been more upset about the friend lying about it. Regardless, I still liked these characters. I really loved Anna's love of cinema.

285,"So I read this book about a week ago and now I feel like I can write this review. All the crazy emotions I got from reading this book have faded so no I can write with a clear head. I just thought that for a book like this it was very important that I do this so that I can get across all of my thoughts on this book. This was a really good story. Short and simple and very interesting. I loved everything about this book except for  that  one thing When someone who has lived in a bubble falls in love for the first time you really want to know how that is going to work out. You just want to know how they live, period. Because of this, Madeline became quite interesting all on her own. I read the blurb and I thought..wow..this is something different  Madeline suffers from SCID so she has been living in her bubble for 17 years. When a boy moves in next door and they become friends, everything changes for her and soon what used to be good enough for her is no longer enough. She wants more, to experience the world like a normal person and spend time with the boy she loves. She decides to do just that and everything is great  until it's not I loved how this author made this book short and simple, you can enjoy and finish this book in a day. There were no unnecessary additions in this book. It made the book fast paced and so much more fun. Every detail in this book felt important so I never got bored. I didn't want to stop reading. Maybe if I hadn't had other things to do I would have been done with this book in a few hours. The characters were all good. Everyone was important and there wasn't that many characters which made more sense because a girl who never leaves the house doesn't know that many people. At first I thought Olly was really weird, in fact I still think he is a bit weird. I am not an energetic person so if you are always jumping up and down and doing all sorts of weird ninja moves I would probably look at you like you have just grown two heads. It was kinda funny though. Who the hell visits a person's house for the first time and starts climbing walls without permission. I have tried to sympathise with Madeline's mom but I can't. Many people lose their loved ones everyday and they don't do anything  that  crazy. Instead of going for therapy she decided to ruin her daughter's life ???? what the hell !! I really liked Madeline, she is really funny. I liked everything she wrote in her books and those spoiler alerts. She is really sweet and didn't deserve what happened to her, no one does. Her relationship with her mom is definitely amazing, most teenagers won't even give their parents the time of day. I wanted to scream when she left the house but I guess I'm glad she did. The illustrations in this book were great too. Really funny and they just made the book more complete. I took my time with all of them because they were one of the best parts of this book. It was even believable that Maddy drew them, they just had that feel to them. Now the one thing I didn't like about this book was the plot twist  what made me read this book was that Madeline had SCID. Her not having SCID just destroys the whole point. I really wish the author would have come up with a different plot twist here. Or none at all. I really liked Made You Up by Francesca Zappia because it was about a girl with schizophrenia. The disease made this story different. It brought something new to the YA table. This book did that but the twist sort of ruined it as well. I would have wanted to know how they were going to make this relationship work while she lived in the bubble. I won't lie, for a plot twist it was a really good one. No one could have seen that one coming. It also made for a sort of happy ending I guess because now they can be together. I can't help but think this is why the author did this. For an easier ending. It still disappoints me though. I did highlight a lot of things on my e-reader but I'm only going to use a few. "" He tastes like salted caramel and sunshine. Or what I think salted caramel and sunshine taste like."" Why anyone would even try to think what sunshine tastes like is beyond me  prom*ise ('pram@s) n. pl.-es. The lie you want to keep. [2015, Whittier]  I just really liked this definition. INVISIBLE MAN BY RALPH ELLISON Spoiler alert: You don't exist if no one can see you. this made me feel bad for her. I really enjoyed this book and I will be looking out for more of Nicola Yoon's books in the future. I totally recommend this book. Even if you are too lazy to read, this book is really short so reading it won't be a problem.

287,"I found Slide pretty absorbing and interesting but ultimately it left me empty. I wanted to like it more than I actually did. I think the basics of the story were good and the author succeeded on several levels, however I think ultimately the plot was too complicated to really execute correctly. Clearly this is meant as the first book to a series and I liked the characters enough to continue with the books I think but I can't help wishing this first book lived up to its inherent promise. It's still a worthwhile read in my opinion but it's not the stunning great read it could have been. That failed expectation was the last impression of the book and thus my disappointment weighs heavily and prominently on my mind when evaluating it. It's a book I'd recommend, but with some qualifications. The book is essentially about the relationship between Ash, a former homeless addict that has cleaned up his life with the help of his lesbian best friend and became a tattoo artist. He moves in with a roommate Pete, a big-hearted paramedic, and the two eventually fall in love. Their relationship is not easy as communication is a word neither man has heard of nor has any interest in and Ash's mental status is often dubious at best. The story is told from both Ash and Pete's POVs mainly to depict Ash's mental deterioration and how someone who is madly in love with him, and even a trained medical professional, can miss important signs. This is definitely an angst filled story and I thought the author did a good job connecting with that emotion but never overwhelming the reader. Ash's childhood was clearly traumatic, to say the least, and his shaky mental status offers no real relief. His relationship to Pete is an obvious grounding force and I liked the two men together. They seemed genuinely in love and happy to be together. However I couldn't help but think they were also two very typical men in their early twenties. They rarely talked, at all or about anything. They mostly let everything slide, which I thought was the motivation for the title. They literally would realize something is bothering the other person or was a sore spot and they simply ""let it go."" For almost the entire book their relationship seems based on the ease with which they live together and great sex whenever they happen to have it. Considering Pete's paramedic job had him working constantly and seemingly always changing hours, the two men weren't together all that much. When they did have a rare night off they usually played video games or hung out, which is fine but it was pretty rare and definitely did not involve communicating to further their relationship. Not that all relationships need extensive communication but considering the near constant problems Ash dealt with, it was clear to see why Pete never really understood Ash and missed all the signals of Ash's mental decline. That said I thought the depiction of Ash's deteriorating mental health was really well done. It was honest and somewhat heartbreaking that everyone around him was so careful that they ignored all his clear cries for help. It shows an honest portrayal that is not always comfortable but genuine nonetheless. The chaotic and often shifting patterns of Ash's speech and mental musings definitely made sense and worked to show the disconnect he had with people and various aspects of life itself. I think the story did an exceptional job in this area and absolutely did not need the overly convenient plot devices about the abuser/baseball bat guy and the sister. Likewise I loathed the epilogue. The entire book sets up this confrontation at the end with Ash realizing he needs help and finally able to ask for it. Then the book jumps a year to show that all was well and includes some pithy lines about how it was hard work to get there. Really? After the entire book shows Ash's slow decline into needing help, then the solution is to say he got some therapy and all's well? I'm sorry but what a cop out. Write a second book if you want to make him well because just skipping ahead has totally reduced any emotional impact the book could have had. It lost me entirely with that cheap shortcut. Overall I quite liked the story and the narrator did a decent job. He acted out the story to my amusement. The narrator would read the line then do it if it was an action he could. For example every time someone would sigh, the narrator would read the line ""Ash took a deep breath."" Then the narrator would breathe deep. It made me laugh because it was just so ... jarring for lack of a better word. But that's a minor point to be sure. I liked the secondary characters even they never really made much sense - Joe is a total mystery and I've no clue why he was included in the story in the awkward way he was - and the characterization wasn't always consistent. However I found these to be minor issues for me and didn't bother me much. Mostly the lack of communication and horrible ending were my biggest issues but I'd still recommend this one.

288,"Going through Rainbow Rowell in backward order on audio. I'm starting to feel like Rebecca Lowman (reader for RR's books) is my personal friend. I liked this one -- it was quieter than Fangirl; it only got plot-intense for me at the end. (And Christiana, I think I found the easter egg!!!) After so many teen books, which are about the ""firsts"" of relationships, I appreciate a book about that very adult truism that a commitment is a choice you make over and over again. Incidentally, I loved all the descriptions of snow. Favorite quotes: ""And she hadn't gotten to say ""I love you""--Georgie always said ""I love you,"" and Neal always said it back, no matter how perfunctory it was. It was a safety check, proof that they were both still in this thing."" ""Seth, however, had never let himself go. If anything, he'd tightened his grip. He looked like he hadn't aged a day since 1994, since the first day he and Georgie met."" When she imagines telling Neal the future on p. 163-164 -- ""We stay in California. You hate it. But you grow your own avocados. So that's something."" ""Neal didn't like to be asked things. It made his jaw tense. He'd give you a flippant answer. Like, whatever you were asking, it wasn't any of your business. Like nothing was anyone's business. Like nobody should ask questions that didn't absolutely need to be answered."" ""She thought of...the way he never made her feel crazy, even when she was acting crazy, and never made her feel like a failure, even when she was failing."" ""Neal wasn't happy, and Georgie was why. And not because of anything she'd ever done or said. Just because of who she was. Georgie was Neal's anchor. (And not the good kind. Not the happy anchor that keeps you safe and grounded, the one you get tattooed across your chest.) Georgie was . dead weight. Okay. Now she was being melodramatic. This was why she never let herself think about this. Because her brain would dive and dive and never touch bottom. She didn't let herself think about it. But she still knew it. Everyone around them knew it--Margaret must. That Neal wasn't happy. That he hated California, that he felt alternately lost and thwarted here.

I was a little bit bothered by Ellie's defiance. I guess it confused me because she kept denying that she was submissive but that's exactly how she was described. Nothing about her behaviour prior to or during her interactions with Kayne hinted at a dominant personality. I understand not accepting or wanting the hand that was dealt to her, I just believe she could have fought against it in another way. I knew it!! I knew Kayne was hiding something. I had a strong inkling that he was an undercover good guy. I appreciate getting his POV because I would fail to realize how wonderful he truly was if his character had to rely solely on how Ellie perceived him. I feel really bad for him in the end.

291,"People conserned more about the topic of this book than the actual story. That's what I basically see in every second review. What are you thirteen year olds? Don't you tell me that you were never attracted to someone besides your partner, I won't believe you ever. It's like saying you never watch porn. You miss the glory of this book, while being too preoccupied with judging and branding characters. This book certainly has flaws, but they have nothing to do with how the love triangle is handled. Coleen Hoover has a very addicting writing style, i flew through this in a matter of hours. The basic idea was treated differently, in a fresh, non-annoying way, which pleased me. It always nice to see another side of the old trope. Characters were quite likable, fleshed out, had their own things to worry about, besides their growing attraction towards each other. They are kind of starting to forget about their worries in the second part of the story, but so do you, it's not bothering. I thorouthly enjoed the love interest in this one - Ridge, he was overall a nice guy, very sweet, dedicated, a talented musician. I love how carefully Hoover treated his deafness, how she didn't make a victim out of him. He was very comfortable in his skin, and he had his agency. You don't have to make your character a douchebag, anyone can fall in love with somebody else. My favorite character though is Maggie. She's an absolute hero! And I was pleasantly surprised that unlike the other girls she was treated normally. It's a solid, emotional read. In the end a little bit overly dramatic, but still worthy of your time.",4,romance,"['people', 'conserne', 'topic', 'book', 'actual', 'story', 'basically', 'second', 'review', 'thirteen', 'year_old', 'tell', 'attract', 'partner', 'will', 'believe', 'like', 'say', 'watch', 'porn', 'miss', 'glory', 'book', 'preoccupied', 'judge', 'brand', 'character', 'book', 'certainly', 'flaw', 'love_triangle', 'handle', 'coleen', 'hoover', 'addicting', 'writing_style', 'fly', 'matter', 'hour', 'basic', 'idea', 'treat', 'differently', 'fresh', 'non', 'annoying', 'way', 'please', 'nice', 'old', 'trope', 'character', 'likable', 'flesh', 'thing', 'worry', 'grow', 'attraction', 'kind', 'start', 'forget', 'worry', 'second', 'story', 'bother', 'thorouthly', 'enjoe', 'love_interest', 'ridge', 'overall', 'nice', 'guy', 'sweet', 'dedicated', 'talented', 'musician', 'love', 'carefully', 'hoover', 'treat', 'deafness', 'victim', 'comfortable', 'skin', 'agency', 'character', 'douchebag', 'fall_love', 'somebody', 'favorite', 'character', 'maggie', 'absolute', 'hero', 'pleasantly_surprised', 'unlike', 'girl', 'treat', 'normally', 'solid', 'emotional', 'read', 'end', 'little', 'bit', 'overly', 'dramatic', 'worthy', 'time']"
292,"4 Stars: How to Handle a Heartbreaker by Marie Harte is the story of how Abby Dunn (a witty, loyal, and intelligent woman with shaky self-worth) finds Brody Singer (a goofy, playful, and sincere guy who tends to hide his problems from everyone rather than reach out for help). It is the second book in the McCauley Brothers series and while it could be read alone, I recommend reading The Troublemaker Next Door first since it contains a fair amount of character building for Abby, Brody, and pretty much everyone else you'll encounter in the story. I was pleasantly surprised by Abby in this book. For a heroine who struggles with self-worth due to some past emotional abuse, she grew in a way I wasn't expecting. I know personal growth is usually a given in contemporary romance, but it so often revolves around the hero and his ultimate acceptance. In this story, however, I knew Abby Dunn would find her happiness, even if it didn't include our hero. Several cliches of contemporary romance made an appearance (love them or leave them), but it also had several unexpected moments for me, which I loved. I tend to expect a hefty dose of the ""man box"" in stories like this (ie obsession with sports, no crying allowed ever, and calling each other pussy). While the men in this series definitely live in the man box, they are NOT assholes about it (so refreshing)! And every once in a while Brody breaks the mold in an adorably sweet way: ""And I really, really want you to come live with me. If you play your cards right, you could be the lucky Mrs. Brody Singer. Unless, of course, you strike it rich. Then I'm okay to take your last name. Brody Dunn has a nice ring to it too."" This was my second book by Marie Harte, so I was curious to see how she would write another set of characters with distinctly different personalities. I thought it was done very well - Brody and Abby were definitely NOT just Flynn and Maddie reincarnate from The Troublemaker Next Door. I hope this trend continues with Vanessa and Cam in Ruining Mr. Perfect. Overall, I really enjoyed this book for what it was, a relaxing and charming romance with some sexy times. It goes especially well with a cup of cocoa and I'm planning to read it again once the holidays roll around. Some Particulars HEA? Yes! Love Triangle? Nope Cheating? Nope Explicit Sex? Oh yeah... Steam Rating: 3 out of 5 Not as much as in The Troublemaker Next Door but there is plenty to go around! Consent? Crystal clear every time :) Trigger Warning? Perhaps a very, very mild one. Abby and Brody each have some emotional and/or physical abuse in their backgrounds (no history of rape or physical sexual abuse). I thought Marie Harte did an excellent job of integrating their pasts into the story without making me feel trapped in the more upsetting parts. It is evident the whole time that both Abby and Brody are surrounded by people who love and support them.",4,romance,"['star', 'handle', 'heartbreaker', 'marie_harte', 'story', 'abby', 'dunn', 'witty', 'loyal', 'intelligent', 'woman', 'shaky', 'self_worth', 'find', 'brody', 'singer', 'goofy', 'playful', 'sincere', 'guy', 'tend', 'hide', 'problem', 'reach', 'help', 'second', 'book', 'mccauley', 'brothers', 'series', 'read', 'recommend', 'read', 'troublemaker_door', 'contain', 'fair', 'character', 'building', 'abby_brody', 'pretty', 'encounter', 'story', 'pleasantly_surprise', 'abby', 'book', 'heroine', 'struggle', 'self_worth', 'past', 'emotional_abuse', 'grow', 'way', 'expect', 'know', 'personal', 'growth', 'usually', 'given', 'contemporary_romance', 'revolve', 'hero', 'ultimate', 'acceptance', 'story', 'know', 'abby', 'dunn', 'find', 'happiness', 'include', 'hero', 'cliche', 'contemporary_romance', 'appearance', 'love', 'leave', 'unexpected', 'moment', 'love', 'tend', 'expect', 'hefty', 'dose', 'man', 'box', 'story', 'like', 'ie', 'obsession', 'sport', 'crying', 'allow', 'call', 'pussy', 'man', 'series', 'definitely', 'live', 'man', 'box', 'asshole', 'refreshing', 'brody', 'break', 'mold', 'adorably', 'sweet', 'way', 'want', 'come', 'live', 'play', 'card', 'right', 'lucky', 'brody', 'singer', 'course', 'strike', 'rich', 'okay', 'brody', 'dunn', 'nice', 'ring', 'second', 'book', 'marie_harte', 'curious', 'write', 'set', 'character', 'distinctly', 'different', 'personality', 'think', 'brody', 'abby', 'definitely', 'flynn', 'maddie', 'reincarnate', 'troublemaker_door', 'hope', 'trend', 'continue', 'vanessa', 'cam', 'ruin', 'perfect', 'overall', 'enjoy', 'book', 'relaxing', 'charming', 'romance', 'sexy', 'time', 'go', 'especially', 'cup', 'cocoa', 'plan', 'read', 'holiday', 'roll', 'particular', 'hea', 'yes', 'love_triangle', 'nope', 'cheating', 'nope', 'explicit', 'sex', 'oh', 'yeah', 'steam', 'rating', 'troublemaker_door', 'plenty', 'consent', 'crystal', 'clear', 'time', 'trigger_warning', 'mild', 'abby_brody', 'emotional', 'physical', 'abuse', 'background', 'history', 'rape', 'physical', 'sexual', 'abuse', 'think', 'marie_harte', 'excellent_job', 'integrate', 'past', 'story', 'make', 'feel', 'trap', 'upsetting', 'part', 'evident', 'time', 'abby_brody', 'surround', 'people', 'love', 'support']"

294,"I didn't read the first two books in the series (""Between the Lines"" and ""Where You Are"") because I hate, hate, HATE love triangles and I wasn't interested in the whole Reid-Emma-Graham drama. But I thought that a story about Reid after he ""lost"" to Graham sounded like a potentially good story. Apart from that I have a weakness for the popular-guy-good-girl-storylines. And Reid is extremely popular. He's a Hollywood star, legendary womanizer and known to find trouble wherever he goes. That's the reason he and Dori meet in the first place. He has drunkenly driven his car into a house front and the following court order was for him to help with the rebuilding of the house - a project that Dori is in charge of. I didn't like Reid in the beginning, mainly because he was acting like an arrogant jerk. Even though I gave him some slack for at least being honest about it and for the fact that he is a Hollywood star and a bit of his arrogance might be founded. When people are constantly telling you how great you are it's only logical. But still, it doesn't change the fact that his behavior left a lot to wish for. He's well aware that Dori is a ""good girl"", she takes love seriously and stays true to her values. But still he's going after her because he likes the challenge, while still hooking up with other girls. Call me stuck-up, but that's one of the meanest things a guy can do in a situation like that. But for me as well as Reid there was a big turning point in this story. I'm not even sure when it happened, but suddenly I felt like he showed some genuine interest in her, like it suddenly became more than just the thrill of the chase. After that the book turned more beautiful with every page. The way Reid tried (and succeeded ) to become a better and more deserving person for Dori's and - what's even more important - his own sake was touching and so wildly romantic that at times I had problems to control my inner fangirl. I felt like squealing happily more than once and I don't do that, ever! I had some problems with the writing style at first. The story is told from ever changing POVs (Reid's and Dori's), there were parts of the book where every third page was told from a different person's POV. It made it hard for me to really get into the story and made me feel a bit restless, but once I got used it I wouldn't have wanted to change it for the world. They were both ruthlessly honest with themselves, so the insights we got into both of their feelings were extremely valuable for the development of the story. The only thing I REALLY didn't like was the whole story arc with her older sister. Maybe the author thought that making Dori's sister and best friend fall into a coma that left her as an unresponsive invalid for the rest of her life was important for the development of the story and Dori's and Reid's relationship, but if you use a character like that to generate some drama (which I hate in the first place), why do you have to make her find the love of her life just before the accident? The whole thing was so heartbreaking I actually had tears in my eyes and more than a few of them were out of anger. That part of the story was completely unnecessary! Apart from that I couldn't have been more delighted with the story. Dori's and Reid's relationship developed with a natural pace and I could understand all of their actions and decisions. They didn't mindlessly rush into anything, but at the same time there was a pull between them that made it almost impossible for them to stay apart. This was a beautiful and touching book about growing up, showing strength in the face of disaster and staying true to yourself through all of it.",5,romance,"['read', 'book', 'series', 'line', 'hate', 'hate', 'hate', 'love_triangle', 'interested', 'reid', 'emma', 'graham', 'drama', 'think', 'story', 'reid', 'lose', 'graham', 'sound', 'like', 'potentially', 'good', 'story', 'apart', 'weakness', 'popular', 'guy', 'good', 'girl', 'storyline', 'reid', 'extremely', 'popular', 'hollywood', 'star', 'legendary', 'womanizer', 'know', 'find', 'trouble', 'go', 'reason', 'dori', 'meet', 'place', 'drunkenly', 'drive', 'car', 'house', 'follow', 'court', 'order', 'help', 'rebuilding', 'house', 'project', 'dori', 'charge', 'like', 'reid', 'beginning', 'mainly', 'act', 'like', 'arrogant', 'jerk', 'give', 'slack', 'honest', 'fact', 'hollywood', 'star', 'bit', 'arrogance', 'found', 'people', 'constantly', 'tell', 'great', 'logical', 'change', 'fact', 'behavior', 'leave', 'lot', 'wish', 'aware', 'dori', 'good', 'girl', 'take', 'love', 'seriously', 'stay_true', 'value', 'go', 'like', 'challenge', 'hook', 'girl', 'stuck', 'mean', 'thing', 'guy', 'situation', 'like', 'reid', 'big', 'turning', 'point', 'story', 'sure', 'happen', 'suddenly', 'feel', 'like', 'show', 'genuine', 'interest', 'like', 'suddenly', 'thrill', 'chase', 'book', 'turn', 'beautiful', 'page', 'way', 'reid', 'try', 'succeed', 'well', 'deserving', 'person', 'dori', 'important', 'sake', 'touching', 'wildly', 'romantic', 'time', 'problem', 'control', 'inner', 'fangirl', 'feel', 'like', 'squeal', 'happily', 'problem', 'writing_style', 'story', 'tell', 'change', 'pov', 'reid', 'dori', 'part', 'book', 'page', 'tell', 'different', 'person', 'pov', 'hard', 'story', 'feel', 'bit', 'restless', 'get', 'want', 'change', 'world', 'ruthlessly', 'honest', 'insight', 'get', 'feeling', 'extremely', 'valuable', 'development', 'story', 'thing', 'like', 'story', 'arc', 'old', 'sister', 'maybe', 'author', 'think', 'make', 'dori', 'sister', 'good', 'friend', 'fall', 'coma', 'leave', 'unresponsive', 'invalid', 'rest', 'life', 'important', 'development', 'story', 'dori', 'reid', 'relationship', 'use', 'character', 'like', 'generate', 'drama', 'hate', 'place', 'find', 'love', 'life', 'accident', 'thing', 'heartbreaking', 'actually', 'tear', 'eye', 'anger', 'story', 'completely', 'unnecessary', 'apart', 'delighted', 'story', 'dori', 'reid', 'relationship', 'develop', 'natural', 'pace', 'understand', 'action', 'decision', 'mindlessly', 'rush', 'time', 'pull', 'impossible', 'stay', 'apart', 'beautiful', 'touching', 'book', 'grow', 'show', 'strength', 'face', 'disaster', 'stay_true']"

296,"I didn't quite enjoy the first book of this series because it didn't match up to my expectations from when I first read its synopsis. But still, I was willing to give the whole series a try. Now that I'm done with the second book, I can say that the story did improve but it was still lacking something for me. Is it just me but this book in the series SORT OF reminded me of Stephenie Meyer's Breaking Dawn. Yes, that fourth book in the Twilight Saga. Which part? The part wherein Guy marries (or proposes to) girl to save her from his family or kind . What I like about this series is that it is very different from all the romance novels that I have read. It tackles a peculiar kind of relationship, one that most people today won't agree to. What they consider as cheating in a relationship is very unusual too. Sooooo...

298,"""Aut viam inveniam aut faciam tibi. I will either find a way or make one."" Oh, those three star reviews... I really did like this book, mainly for the somewhat unused idea of a male lead with complete amnesia. And the name Logan tattooed on him. I thought the fact that Ashlyn was a student headed for a PhD and writing her thesis on amnesia sort of fell by the wayside after it was used as an excuse for them to meet. There really wasn't a lot of it in the story. I thought the little twist toward the end was a great surprise and oh, so angsty! Seriously...that's what was going on? What a great OMG moment  when we figure out who Logan really is. The most enjoyable part of this story is how Logan gets to learn all over again how to live and what he loves. He gets to look at the world and everything in it with fresh eyes, untainted by sadness or hate or prejudice. ""Logan, with no memory of his own life was teaching me how to live in the moment and enjoy mine."" I must be a bit immune to super sexy steamy scenes because I really don't see this a being all that erotic. There were a couple of somewhat descriptive love scenes but to me, erotic means that sex takes over much of the page time and that was definitely not the case here. There was a lot of story. All centered around how Logan and Ashlyn have this somewhat taboo relationship. I was surprised that more fuss wasn't made about how she, a student, became involved with him, a suspected murderer with amnesia. That seems to be quite the faux pas, but no one really seemed to mind all that much. A very enjoyable read, just not a huge standout among the hundreds like it. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator did a great job. I will likely continue the series, as I liked this author's voice.",3,romance,"['aut', 'viam', 'inveniam', 'aut', 'faciam', 'tibi', 'find', 'way', 'oh', 'star', 'review', 'like', 'book', 'mainly', 'somewhat', 'unused', 'idea', 'male', 'lead', 'complete', 'amnesia', 'logan', 'tattoo', 'think', 'fact', 'ashlyn', 'student', 'head', 'phd', 'write', 'thesis', 'amnesia', 'sort', 'fall', 'wayside', 'excuse', 'meet', 'lot', 'story', 'think', 'little', 'twist', 'end', 'great', 'surprise', 'oh', 'angsty', 'seriously', 'go', 'great', 'omg', 'moment', 'figure', 'logan', 'enjoyable', 'story', 'logan', 'get', 'learn', 'live', 'love', 'get', 'look', 'world', 'fresh', 'eye', 'untainted', 'sadness', 'hate', 'prejudice', 'logan', 'memory', 'life', 'teach', 'live', 'moment', 'enjoy', 'bit', 'immune', 'super', 'sexy', 'steamy', 'scene', 'erotic', 'couple', 'somewhat', 'descriptive', 'love', 'scene', 'erotic', 'mean', 'sex', 'take', 'page', 'time', 'definitely', 'case', 'lot', 'story', 'center', 'logan', 'ashlyn', 'somewhat', 'taboo', 'relationship', 'surprised', 'fuss', 'student', 'involved', 'suspect', 'murderer', 'amnesia', 'faux', 'pas', 'mind', 'enjoyable', 'read', 'huge', 'standout', 'hundred', 'like', 'listen_audiobook', 'narrator', 'great', 'job', 'likely', 'continue', 'series', 'like', 'author', 'voice']"

300,"The basic premise of this book (good girl meets bad boy) is one that had been done countless times, and yet it is one that I've recently grown rather fond of in this new adult genre. Ever since buying it, I've been anxious to pick it up, but I had a few more books that I had queued to be read before getting to it, even though this book kept catching my eye and demanding to be read sooner rather than later. I've glad I gave it and pushed this book a little higher on my schedule. It was only a week before reading it that I realized the actual seriousness of what this books back blurb slightly hints at. I was looking for books with serious and real life situations on Goodreads when I came across this book in the top ten on of a list I was surfing through. I thought maybe I'd bitten off a slightly more darker story then I had first anticipated. Tammara Webber's Easy starts off with every persons worst nightmare. I admit I wasn't expecting the confrontation straight off the bat, but it just concludes and adds to the fact that even though this particular story is a work of fiction, this kind of thing can happen at anytime and anywhere. Even when diving straight in, I knew I was going to really enjoy this book. It seemed to feel so much more real and truthful depiction of teens and young adults then what authors usually portray. These seemed like real college students. I for one, am extremely grateful for the main character actually not being a virgin. I can only take so many 'good girl virgins'. I ended up not only liking and loving Jacqueline, but admiring her too. The secondary characters contribute to making this story feel real. I really loved Erin, not only for attitude and witty lines, but also her unwavering support for her best friend. I enjoyed every passage that she was in. I loved the small doses of Benji, and I freely admit that I liked the presence of Jacqueline's ex not quite leaving the picture. I needed to know what would happen to Jacqueline, I couldn't leave her world alone. I read through the whole thing in just over a day. Easy hits on some hard-hitting truths, and I'm very grateful that the author decided not to gloss over it or sweep it under the rug. Not only does it show the truth that rape can happen to anyone, but also shows it can be carried out by people you presume to know. Not only does it touch on the physical and emotional wounds of rape, it's also based strongly on the emotional effects of forgiveness, self-doubt, and hope. Briefly, it even touches on what some people are willing to do to cover the word 'rape'. Most importantly, Tammara Webber shows us that, no matter how the situation comes into play, non-consensual sex is rape, and rape is never your fault. Moving away now from the more serious aspects of this book. I want to say that I really loved Lucas. I didn't find him at all creepy or stalkerish just because he had already drawn pictures of Jacqueline. I love an artistic type, and if you've read any of my reviews before, you might know that I have a certain fondness for damaged characters. Whether just small amounts of trauma, to shit hit the fan crazy psychological scarring. I admired Lucas' need to protect people, even if it was just by volunteering at self-defense classes. That one bit, right at the very end, after Buck's failed third attempt at assaulting Jacqueline... When he sort of crawls towards her and holds her. It just felt powerful for me, like I knew that he hadn't been able to save his mother, so this time she needed to be ok. I'm grateful that Tammara Webber took the time to write this book, and she should be incredibly proud of what she has achieved with her novel. I knew from the very beginning that this book deserved 5 stars and I'm not glad that I can give it so freely. Easy will stay with me forever.",5,romance,"['basic', 'premise', 'book', 'good', 'girl', 'meet', 'bad', 'boy', 'countless', 'time', 'recently', 'grow', 'fond', 'new', 'adult', 'genre', 'buy', 'anxious', 'pick', 'book', 'queue', 'read', 'get', 'book', 'keep', 'catch', 'eye', 'demand', 'read', 'soon', 'later', 'glad', 'give', 'push', 'book', 'little', 'higher', 'schedule', 'week', 'read', 'realize', 'actual', 'seriousness', 'book', 'blurb', 'slightly', 'hint', 'look', 'book', 'real', 'life', 'situation', 'goodreads', 'come', 'book', 'list', 'surf', 'think', 'maybe', 'bite', 'slightly', 'dark', 'story', 'anticipate', 'tammara_webber', 'easy', 'start', 'person', 'bad', 'nightmare', 'admit', 'expect', 'confrontation', 'straight', 'bat', 'conclude', 'add', 'fact', 'particular', 'story', 'work', 'fiction', 'kind', 'thing', 'happen', 'anytime', 'dive', 'straight', 'know', 'go', 'enjoy', 'book', 'feel', 'real', 'truthful', 'depiction', 'teen', 'young_adult', 'author', 'usually', 'portray', 'like', 'real', 'college', 'student', 'extremely', 'grateful', 'main_character', 'actually', 'virgin', 'good', 'girl', 'virgin', 'end', 'like', 'love', 'jacqueline', 'admire', 'secondary_character', 'contribute', 'make', 'story', 'feel', 'real', 'love', 'erin', 'attitude', 'witty', 'line', 'unwavering', 'support', 'good', 'friend', 'enjoy', 'passage', 'love', 'small', 'dose', 'benji', 'freely', 'admit', 'like', 'presence', 'jacqueline', 'ex', 'leave', 'picture', 'need', 'know', 'happen', 'jacqueline', 'leave', 'world', 'read', 'thing', 'day', 'easy', 'hit', 'hard', 'hit', 'truth', 'grateful', 'author', 'decide', 'gloss', 'sweep', 'rug', 'truth', 'rape', 'happen', 'show', 'carry', 'people', 'presume', 'know', 'touch', 'physical', 'emotional', 'wound', 'rape', 'base', 'strongly', 'emotional', 'effect', 'forgiveness', 'self', 'doubt', 'hope', 'briefly', 'touch', 'people', 'willing', 'cover', 'word', 'rape', 'importantly', 'tammara_webber', 'show', 'matter', 'situation', 'come', 'play', 'non', 'consensual', 'sex', 'rape', 'rape', 'fault', 'move', 'away', 'aspect', 'book', 'want', 'love', 'lucas', 'find', 'creepy', 'stalkerish', 'draw', 'picture', 'jacqueline', 'love', 'artistic', 'type', 'read', 'review', 'know', 'certain', 'fondness', 'damage', 'character', 'small', 'amount', 'trauma', 'shit', 'hit', 'fan', 'crazy', 'psychological', 'scarring', 'admire', 'lucas', 'need', 'protect', 'people', 'volunteer', 'self', 'defense', 'class', 'bit', 'right', 'end', 'buck', 'fail', 'attempt', 'assault', 'jacqueline', 'sort', 'crawl', 'hold', 'feel', 'powerful', 'like', 'know', 'able', 'save', 'mother', 'time', 'need', 'ok', 'grateful', 'tammara_webber', 'take', 'time', 'write', 'book', 'incredibly', 'proud', 'achieve', 'novel', 'know', 'beginning', 'book', 'deserve', 'star', 'glad', 'freely', 'easy', 'stay', 'forever']"
301,"OH MY GOD I just noticed that this book came out EXACTLY two years ago. February 10th. This is awesome. Wow!! Great start to romance week! That felt like a really long journey. I wasn't so engrossed in the romace at the beginning, what kept me going was mainly the plot and Lucas' memories. However, the last 100 pages were like an emotional roller coaster! I loved the ending a lot. Despite the sci-fi elements of it, the story felt very realistic to me. To be honest, I didn't like the beginning at all. I didn't like Juliet and Lucas' instant love and their realtionship, but as the story progressed and came to the point where Lucas lost his memories and became sort of 'different' I began to miss the old one too. It was all very eerie and heart-wrenching. Even though I realized they would break up, as he told her in the past, it still made me sad and frustrated. I loved the jump in the years and that we got to see Juliet's life later on. Honestly, the scene where the phone rang in her office and her assistant was talking about a hospital in Germany broke my heart. I was like OHHHMYYYGOOODDDD It's happening. I'm glad Lucas hadn't died. I wish we could have seen their reunion, but I also like that it's an open ending. I mean, we know that she's flying to him, but we are left to imagine the rest... I don't know why, but bittersweet endings don't make me as mad as I think I should have been.",4,romance,"['oh_god', 'notice', 'book', 'come', 'exactly', 'year_ago', 'february', 'awesome', 'wow', 'great', 'start', 'romance', 'week', 'feel', 'like', 'long', 'journey', 'engrossed', 'romace', 'beginning', 'keep', 'go', 'mainly', 'plot', 'lucas', 'memory', 'page', 'like', 'emotional', 'roller', 'coaster', 'love', 'ending', 'lot', 'despite', 'sci_fi', 'element', 'story', 'feel', 'realistic', 'honest', 'like', 'beginning', 'like', 'juliet', 'lucas', 'instant', 'love', 'realtionship', 'story', 'progress', 'come', 'point', 'lucas', 'lose', 'memory', 'sort', 'different', 'begin', 'miss', 'old', 'eerie', 'heart_wrench', 'realize', 'break', 'tell', 'past', 'sad', 'frustrated', 'love', 'jump', 'year', 'get', 'juliet', 'life', 'later', 'honestly', 'scene', 'phone', 'ring', 'office', 'assistant', 'talk', 'hospital', 'germany', 'break_heart', 'like', 'ohhhmyyygooodddd', 'happen', 'glad', 'lucas', 'die', 'wish', 'see', 'reunion', 'like', 'open', 'ending', 'mean', 'know', 'fly', 'leave', 'imagine', 'rest', 'know', 'bittersweet', 'ending', 'mad', 'think']"
302,"As is usual lately, this is one of my stream of consciousness reviews: It's making me cry and not where you'd think. Well, there, too. There's a LOT of talking in this. There's telling through the talking, big paragraphs. It's moving really slowly now. I don't need to know everything they're talking about when they're just chatting. It's realistic, yes, so is me trying to explain to my 14-year-old why it's important to leave voice mail if you want an adult to call you back, but no one wants to read about it. Heck you've probably stopped reading this review now because it's so boring. Not breaking a lot of ethnic stereotypes here: Latina maid, evil crazies were in South America, white people are the wealthy and perfect owners of the house. Dweeb? That's so 1956. That is used WAY too often in this book. This is doing a really good job of showing how difficult it is for Zach to function and how inconsistent he is in behavior. It's not all simplified like in a lot of books. The erratic behavior in particular is rarely acknowledged and it's so common. Every once in a while a Britishism squeaks in. If it were the same character who used it, I'd assume that person were British, but it isn't. Is the author Brit? We don't put ""love"" at the end of sentences. We don't say ""git"" unless we watch too much BBC America and Red Dwarf, smeghead. Where are they in Colorado? In the mountains of the Rockies and Cascades, the water is completely safe to drink because it's snow run off. So where are they? Thank you for getting this right: People don't pass out from pain. Certainly not at the level people pass out from in books. Pain is your body trying to give you signals to get away from whatever is causing the pain. People pass out because they have a head injury or have lost too much blood or they looked passed out because they've gone catatonic from shock. The human body can endure incredible amounts of pain in order to stay ready to run. Why would scars made more than two years ago still look red? Even if they were from reparative surgery, he's been back 8-9 months now. Great description of a severe panic attack. Zach correcting their grammar is funny when he made glaring adverb mistakes along the line of ""go slow"" and ""it felt real good to me."" No, he will never put this completely behind him. But he will grow from it and it won't run his life or be present in everything he does. He'll get to a point where he doesn't think about it all the time, every day, or maybe even every month. He'll get to a point where it won't define him. But it will never be completely behind him and it really wouldn't make sense for it to. It's changed him and his life and his choices and his future irrevocably. A little too much sex but it's hot and varied. Really hot. I don't like the psychiatrist. He mostly says the right things but it feels so condescending and too soft which isn't something someone like Zach would respond to. People need to relate to their counselors in some way, if only on the surface. For example, if someone laughs a lot and uses humor to deflect, you wouldn't give that person someone somber. You'd set them up with someone with a positive personality that could model appropriate humor and help the person understand inappropriate times for making jokes. That's just an example; it's not like I deflect with humor. Or sarcasm, no, that's not like me at all. It's realistic that Zach started to run away when David was hurting about Jerry  and great that he then went back and even sounded like he understood what David was upset about. A man as smart and well read wouldn't need to study for the GED and certainly not intensely. The five tests are really only English (including writing) and math, and if he can correct someone's grammar and read those heavy scientific books, he's set. (The other tests, history and science, aren't knowledge tests; they're reading comprehension using passages in these subjects. You read a passage about something historical for example and the answer questions about what happened in the passage. The reason that these are hard for people is that these are areas where someone might have difficult comprehending the text because they don't understand science or have a mental block and just automatically hate history or something.) It's creepy that they call their home a compound, especially since the paramilitary org that took Zach probably called their base that, too. Zach's progress once he and David finally got together was ridiculously and unbelievably fast. I can never find chairs that are high enough to wedge under a door knob. Have you? Instead I get a handy seat to be first in line to watch any intruders storm my castle. (Oh that's vaguely sexual I think...or not.) I keep waiting for something exciting to happen since that's how it started, like maybe Estoban  comes back from the dead as a zombie to enact his revenge, but instead of brains, he wants balls. (You know you have to give it some kind of twist.) I don't get why having a long distance relationship  will help. Maybe doing it for a few months, or maybe they shouldn't move in together right away . But this way it just sounds like it's setting them up to fail. I don't buy that it worked out perfectly as planned. Overall it was good. The action and peril and hospital scene were all in the beginning whereas I prefer it at the end, and it dragged in places, but the description of the various mental health issues was done really well. (Yes, PTSD is a mental disorder and so are panic attacks. People need to stop with the stigmatizing of mental illness.)",4,romance,"['usual', 'lately', 'stream', 'consciousness', 'review', 'make', 'cry', 'think', 'lot', 'talking', 'tell', 'talking', 'big', 'paragraph', 'move', 'slowly', 'need', 'know', 'talk', 'chat', 'realistic', 'yes', 'try', 'explain', 'year_old', 'important', 'leave', 'voice', 'mail', 'want', 'adult', 'want', 'read', 'heck', 'probably', 'stop', 'read', 'review', 'boring', 'break', 'lot', 'ethnic', 'stereotype', 'latina', 'maid', 'evil', 'crazy', 'south', 'america', 'white', 'people', 'wealthy', 'perfect', 'owner', 'house', 'dweeb', 'way', 'book', 'good_job', 'show', 'difficult', 'zach', 'function', 'inconsistent', 'behavior', 'simplify', 'like', 'lot', 'book', 'erratic', 'behavior', 'particular', 'rarely', 'acknowledge', 'common', 'britishism', 'squeak', 'character', 'assume', 'person', 'british', 'author', 'brit', 'love', 'end', 'sentence', 'git', 'watch', 'bbc', 'america', 'red', 'dwarf', 'smeghead', 'colorado', 'mountain', 'rockies', 'cascades', 'water', 'completely', 'safe', 'drink', 'snow', 'run', 'thank', 'get', 'right', 'people', 'pass', 'pain', 'certainly', 'level', 'people', 'pass', 'book', 'pain', 'body', 'try', 'signal', 'away', 'cause', 'pain', 'people', 'pass', 'head', 'injury', 'lose', 'blood', 'look', 'pass', 'go', 'catatonic', 'shock', 'human', 'body', 'endure', 'incredible', 'amount', 'pain', 'order', 'stay', 'ready', 'run', 'scar', 'year_ago', 'look', 'red', 'reparative', 'surgery', 'month', 'great', 'description', 'severe', 'panic_attack', 'zach', 'correct', 'grammar', 'funny', 'glaring', 'adverb', 'mistake', 'line', 'slow', 'feel', 'real', 'good', 'completely', 'grow', 'will', 'run', 'life', 'present', 'point', 'think', 'time', 'day', 'maybe', 'month', 'point', 'will', 'define', 'completely', 'sense', 'change', 'life', 'choice', 'future', 'irrevocably', 'little', 'sex_hot', 'varied', 'hot', 'like', 'psychiatrist', 'say', 'right', 'thing', 'feel', 'condescending', 'soft', 'like', 'zach', 'respond', 'people', 'need', 'relate', 'counselor', 'way', 'surface', 'example', 'laugh', 'lot', 'use', 'humor', 'deflect', 'person', 'somber', 'set', 'positive', 'personality', 'model', 'appropriate', 'humor', 'help', 'person', 'understand', 'inappropriate', 'time', 'make', 'joke', 'example', 'like', 'deflect', 'humor', 'sarcasm', 'like', 'realistic', 'zach', 'start', 'run_away', 'david', 'hurt', 'jerry', 'great', 'go', 'sound', 'like', 'understand', 'david', 'upset', 'man', 'smart', 'read', 'need', 'study', 'ged', 'certainly', 'intensely', 'test', 'english', 'include', 'writing', 'math', 'correct', 'grammar', 'read', 'heavy', 'scientific', 'book', 'set', 'test', 'history', 'science', 'knowledge', 'test', 'read', 'comprehension', 'passage', 'subject', 'read', 'passage', 'historical', 'example', 'answer_question', 'happen', 'passage', 'reason', 'hard', 'people', 'area', 'difficult', 'comprehend', 'text', 'understand', 'science', 'mental', 'block', 'automatically', 'hate', 'history', 'creepy', 'home', 'compound', 'especially', 'paramilitary', 'org', 'take', 'zach', 'probably', 'call', 'base', 'zach', 'progress', 'david', 'finally', 'get', 'ridiculously', 'unbelievably', 'fast', 'find', 'chair', 'high', 'wedge', 'door', 'knob', 'instead', 'handy', 'seat', 'line', 'watch', 'intruder', 'storm', 'castle', 'oh', 'vaguely', 'sexual', 'think', 'wait', 'exciting', 'happen', 'start', 'like', 'maybe', 'estoban', 'come', 'dead', 'zombie', 'enact', 'revenge', 'instead', 'brain', 'want', 'ball', 'know', 'kind', 'twist', 'have', 'long', 'distance', 'relationship', 'help', 'maybe', 'month', 'maybe', 'right_away', 'way', 'sound', 'like', 'set', 'fail', 'buy', 'work', 'perfectly', 'plan', 'overall', 'good', 'action', 'peril', 'hospital', 'scene', 'beginning', 'prefer', 'end', 'drag', 'place', 'description', 'mental_health', 'issue', 'yes', 'ptsd', 'mental', 'disorder', 'panic_attack', 'people', 'need', 'stop', 'stigmatizing', 'mental_illness']"
303,"I absolutely love this book. I randomly picked it up from a bargain book stack at a bookstore and have read it about a half dozen times and still find myself wanting to read it again. The story is quite heart warming and exciting at the same time. I found Heath and Anabelle to be amazing characters and quite lovable. I expected to hate Heath at first glance but he most certainly grew on me even though he did play quite the hard ass at first. I also liked the romance between  Porcia and Bodie. I thought it really gave a deeper look into the crazy that love can bring out in all of us just on a grander scale.

304,"An absolutely heart warming read! I listened to this on my Kindle for part of the time because I had things to do and couldn't stand the idea of putting the book down. Johnny Rayne is a rockstar at the top of the charts but he's been there 15 years and he's tired and wants a family, so he leaves his band and moves to the mountains of West Virginia. His first day there, he meets Sheriff Virgil Grissom. Johnny has always denied his feelings toward men and never explored them but Grissom wakes him up to what he's been missing and makes him realize how much more there is for him when the person is truly right for him. They make a great couple. Johnny can be a bit of a princess, but hey, he's been a famous, beautiful rockstar for the past 15 years so what do you expect. But not annoyingly so. He's trying VERY hard to be anonymous in town. Grissom can be very pushy and know-it-all at times but not in a mean way and usually he's doing it just because he enjoys baiting Johhny who readily rises to the occasion. The sex was hot but not too much aside from the... ahem... fisting scene... ahem... :o)   Johnny has a strong desire to adopt a child and Grissom helps in this regard. Suffice it to say they make great daddies. This was the first book I read by this author and I will most definitely be looking for her other books. The writing was solid and well edited. Great plot that unfolded at just the right pace. This book gave me the warm-and-fuzzies many times over. A definite 5 star read!

305,"I loved this. It was sweet and funny and kind reminded me of TJ Klunes At First Sight series in that regard. I got annoyed at the main character, much like I did in Klunes books, but they kinda grew on me in the end. I didn't actually know this was set in Australia funnily enough. It was nice seeing places I've been to, and the start of this was written in a way that I didn't know where it was set until someone mentioned Melbourne and then finally a bridge in Sydney. Overall it was hella sweet and some moments had me teary eyed (at the gym after the trainers comp, god I felt sorry for reed that must have been so confusing and hard for him) but I didn't like the ending.

306,"I was waiting for this book for a very very long time (I still feel guilty for liking Royals that much). However, I expected this book to be: 1) lame in the oh-all-that-highschool-drama way, 2) predictable in the I'll-pretend-to-be-your-girlfriend-for-no-good-reason-though-I-dislike-you-for-no-good-reason way, 3) stereotypical in the prince-meets-cinderella-and-falls-in-love way, So, yeah, I was dying to read what I expected to be a cliche book. And I'd lie if I said that it wasn't. It was. It had everything one can expect - a pampered pop music star, an orphan cinderella that takes care of her little brothers, an ex that was not worth the main heroine and a HAE in the end . Why 4 stars then? Because it was good. The style, the characters, the romance - everything felt so right. I can't find better fitting word. It was natural. Easy. I immediately felt for the main heroes, because they weren't perfect. I have to admit that the chemistry between them sometimes lacked something (on the other hand, it's an YA book and therefore I understand why there were no... you know... *get's embarrassed and looks around* those scenes. Oakley and Vaughn are portrayed as... well... normal people? They kinda become friends and the falls in love. No magic, no sparks flying around. No ""The only one"". More ""It's real between us and lets be happy about that for now"". I liked how calm and civilized the process of falling in love was. I know it's unusual to say so, but this was... refreshing.

O.O It really was a bit cliche. Very emotional (both for the characters and for the reader. And in was emotional in a good way - believable and not forced). I loved that I actually could believe in characters' decisions. I didn't need to cling my teeth while reading some nonsense - the author made some reasonable choices, so the story, emotionally heavy and pretty complicated, was nonetheless persuasive. I really liked how the characters interacted in the letters. The letters definitely were the strongest side of the book. Their real live relationship wasn't that interesting, but, again, I give the author credits for making it believable. Believe me, I know something about judging people without knowing them, so... I was a bit surprised by the calmness of Declan finding out about Juliet and vice versa. A lot of similar books make it awkward and silly - I just can't stand it. But Letters to the Lost succeeded to both show the reconciliation in this very calm matter-of-fact way.

310,"Wow... I really had low expectations for this book. However, this exceeded them and surprisingly was a pretty decent read mainly because the writing was so well done. They way the story was paced and how the events unfolded naturally really helped sell this as a book that makes you want to keep reading when it so easily could have failed. This book can be described as The Bachelor in a castle with a dash of The Hunger Games because its set in post World War 3 America. I really ended up enjoying this book because the protagonist, America, was a genuinely likable character. Considering this story could have easily just turned into a vapid beauty pageant, it was really refreshing to have a heroine that wasn't a whiny brat. Yes, it's super romancey and there is a lot of talk about dresses and cat fights but America is someone you really don't mind. She's super relate-able and is someone you would want to be friends with. I felt the build of a relationship between America and Maxon was actually handled well. Definitely wasn't insta-love and wasn't overly antagonistic to add needless drama. Overall, it felt well paced and sweet. Ok, I admit that her an Maxon's first kiss was super SQUEEEEE worthy. What can I say, I'm a softy at heart! There's a love triangle because of course there is. There always is. America is obviously confused as to where her heart and head are but she's not whiny about it! (Seriously, her lack of griping saves the day for this story!) Again, I felt the writing was particularly well done in describing the two different relationships. The pacing and America's personality really helps the whole triangle thing to not be hideously annoying. They have a side plot involving the political intrigue of the new nation. There is talk of rebels and attacks throughout the country. They also hint that the royal family may be hiding some of the truth about their rise to power and other secrets from the people. However, they only hint at these things. It would have been interesting to cover more ground on that front. The story mainly focuses on the competition and the romance. If more of the political aspects were addressed I may have given this 5 stars. Since they weren't I had to take away 1 star. Maybe they will be more prominent issues in the next book? Overall, Kiera Cass is a very talented writer. This is usually a book that would be a DNF for me. However, her writing and characters were so well done that this turned out to be a surprise hit for me.

315,"First of all. The writing in this book was beautiful. I actually cannot think of another book where I stopped in the midst of reading to admire the author's work with words. I gave this three stars BECAUSE OF the marvelous, almost artistic writing. If it had not been so beautiful and witty this book would have received a two. That is what writing should be. Artistic. Now onto the main part of the book. The story. I am still still not sure how I feel about the story. Their love in a way reminded me of the love in Crash by Nicole Williams or Beautiful Disaster by Jamie McGuire. It is a desperate kind of strung out love that in my book is no where near healthy. In this book the MC understands that and yet sticks with the love (which is explained in the book by her 'daddy issues'). Honestly when the broke up I thought that the book was going to be redeemed. It could be like a real life romance where the guy she fell so desperately in love with was the asshole he seemed to be and after a horrible shitty break up, you have the chance to remake yourself. I would have loved this story if that had happened, and she had not ended up going back to him in the end. Maybe if they had bumped into each other later, when she was happy without him and not angry. Just accepting what he was to her, that he changed her, and that they could never have a healthy relationship.

316,"With a page count of 416, I expected way more out of This is What Happy Looks Like. I'm convinced that even with 300 pages, the story would've had adequate room to breathe. In fact, I expect a whole lot more depth out of a thicker book, especially when it's Contemporary. There's little world building required in Contemporary, so the complexity needs to lie a lot more in the plot and the characters. Sadly, I didn't see that complexity that I expected. Somehow the characters, while not one-dimensional per se, didn't hold my interest for long. The initial email exchanges were cool and kinda funny too since it turns out Graham has a pet pig but once the book transitioned to ""real life"", there wasn't all that much left to hold my interest. No twists and turns. Just an introduction of conflicts in the first few chapters that were all resolved in a very predictable manner towards the end. Most of the chapters in between read like fillers to me. The least that could've come out of this would've been a sweet romance that leisure unfolded between the pages. Alas, that didn't happen either. Despite all the time in the world that could've been contained in the middle chapters, I have to cry out instalove! I mean, come on! Graham already planned to spend his week-long break from filming with Ellie practically the moment he laid his eyes on her. Sure, they had emailed each other for a couple of months and so it might come off as though they had known each other a while. All well and good. But the basis of their real life relationship didn't solidify much over the course of the weeks, so what was the point of it all, I ask! I don't mind reading books where readers mostly experience characters' day-to-day lives and no crazy plot twists happen. They don't all need to be issues book with heart-wrenching stories. Neither do they have to be so hilarious, I can't hold my laughter in. I do however require depth in those cases. I want to see what makes those characters tick and why they make the choices the way they do. Even if a book is meant to portray a sweet romance, there has to be something more than just that. There has to be more to the characters and the plot. Doesn't help that a third through the book I thought, ""Here's a good place to end. I don't need to read the rest to know what happens anyway."" That's why I decided the book just wasn't for me. It was light-hearted yet so incredibly long-drawn and these two things don't go well together for me. If a book is light-hearted, then it shouldn't waste too many words to get to the point. If it's long-drawn, it better be because it's building up the suspense and makes the wait worth it. The combination of these two only makes sense to me if a good measure of philosophising is thrown in or good measure. That obviously wasn't the case in This is What Happy Looks Like. It could've turned out to be a nice little tale to while away a couple of hours like The Statistical Probability of Love at First Sight but for that I found it too thick a book.

317,"huh - this one is tough to rate. It is probably a 2.5 stars because I like some of my 3 stars and might read them again. This one I will not. The story was ok and I sort of liked the H - when he was not inexplicably distant or unavailable. But the dialogue was really immature.

318,"Oh. My. God. Simon Parker put his arm around me! Like, in front of everyone! Wait, this wasn't high school. This wasn't even my high school. But that didn't stop girls from throwing eye daggers at me from all corners of the room. I smirked a little, preening with my shoulder candy. I really liked this book, it was everything that made the first one so good, the characters, the writing style, the comedy. However while a really enjoyed it I didn't loved it as much as the first one. I got a little angry at Caroline sometimes  like when Simon starts cutting down his trips and all, I was like, seriously? Your insanely hot and sweet boyfriend wants to be home a little more and you don't like that? What was wrong with her?! But she's still a great female character and I enjoyed being in her mind for a while. I enjoyed reading again about all the gang and that dramas between them, it is always hilarious while they're together and damn I really want Caroline's life, like I can totally picture myself being her lol. I really didn't liked the epilogue  I don't know maybe because I'm a more of a dog person but I just found kind of ridiculous that it was from Clive's POV, and OMG did they really kept the five cats?! And well as for Wallbanger, there's nothing I enjoyed in this book more than him. I really liked that we got to know him a little better, going into his past and stuff, meeting high school Simon and all of that, seriously I loved that damn high school reunion! And he's one of my favorite male characters. Simon excused himself from who he was talking to and started toward me, Trevor and the apostles in tow. I know it's not logical; I know it's not even physically possible--but I swear on all that is holy, they walked in slow motion. Like in some kind of action movie. Simon took point, Trevor just off to his left, and the rest slightly behind, like geese in a V. Everyone stopped to watch. It was like the sexiest train wreck ever; no one could look away. Was this sequel necessary? No it wasn't. Did I enjoyed it? Hell yes! I was laughing out loud in most chapters which is something that I loved from this series, I love Alice Clayton because she has like the most ingenious ideas ever and always makes me laugh my ass off. I'm giving it a five stars because well I can't give Simon any less than that!

319,"I really loved this but the ending annoyed me a little. It's the one thing I hate about contemporary YA. when they leave things open in a ""you can imagine on your own how it ends and how their lives pan out"" kind of way. If I wanted to imagine I would've written the damn thing myself. I want YOU, the author to tell me exactly what happens. I don't want a HFN I want a HEA where I know exactly how their lives pan out. Sorry, random rant that I just needed to say. There were a few times when I would think ""hmm"" and there were times where I kinda felt like I just needed more (besides the ending, just more of the story I guess? ), but I won't deny that this held my attention from the very beginning. Also the drawings were really cool and really made me wish I had a physical copy. But besides that I'm really happy I read this.

320,"Well, this book probably deserves more than a three star rating, but going by Goodreads' guide, 3 stars means 'I liked it', which, in a nutshell, was exactly what I did. I enjoyed this book - it had an interesting main character, large cast of varied side characters, and some really cute and quality scenes - but there were certain aspects of it which drove me just the slightest bit crazy. In the grand scheme of the book, these probably weren't big things at all, but maybe they'll just always be that little something with Kiera Cass's storytelling that rubs me the wrong way. In The Heir, a couple of those things were: The political aspect. The problems the royal family are now facing in the aftermath of abolishing the castes felt really stupid to me and just like the author was trying to invent problems. I understand that in any government there's going to be problems and conflict, but this just didn't work for me. Also, the way Eadlyn and Maxon kept generalising all their people into one 'they' was very annoying, seeing as every story they heard clearly had two sides to it. Oh, and - just a tiny thing here - the introduction of a character named Aspel. I don't usually have a problem with unusual character names - authors should be able to name their characters whatever they want (for example I'm totally fine with names like Gunner, Ean and Fox, not to mention Cass's apparent obsession with names beginning with 'A'). But really. Really? You already have a main character called Aspen, then you introduce one called Aspel. I'm sorry, but that just felt really strange to me. I'm definitely not saying Kiera Cass is a bad author here - it's just that this book presented a lot of problems for me along the way. I think was expecting a little more from this book, but it was still enjoyable and added a new dimension to the series, which was pretty cool. I would say if you loved the first three Selection books, you'd enjoy this one.

321,"3.5 stars, because I have mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, it's a rather complex exploration of a sexual assault survivor claiming her sexuality that includes a lot of hot sex scenes. On the other hand, she characterizes her struggles with sex after sexual assault as her being ""broken"" and basically gets ""cured"" by a good man (who has struggles of his own). As books go on this theme this is one of the best I have read, in terms of it's complexity, which isn't saying much really. I honestly feel that this theme is better off as literary fiction as opposed to romance, but damn do romance writers love it. Cured by love, or cured by sex with the right person is a huge theme in so many romances and I would really like it to end. Trauma doesn't work this way. The main character seems to not really have any trauma symptoms outside of the impact on her sex life, which feels unrealistic. Despite this, I did really enjoy the dynamic of these two characters. I liked watching their relationship build. I liked each of them individually. I cared about them and their own growth arcs, and I rooted for them as a couple. This book holds a lot of humor and hotness and I liked that, especially given the central theme. As fantasy arcs for survivors go, this had some satisfying pieces to it. That it felt like it could hold that much complexity and still honor the hard stuff shows how very talented this writer is.

322,"Have you written a review that you probably don't even know how to express your feeling or what you felt while reading it? Whelp this is me right now. Writing this was hard for me, not because I have being through this. It was mostly for the emotional and private part that Colleen tried to incorporate in. Which for me gets difficult to comment or even say my thoughts of the book. So, let me say first that this book was a wreck of emotions that are not even mine but I cried like crazy reaching at the end of the book. When she explains the story behind it. Lily had to face on an early stage of her life seeing her dad abusing her mother physically which really sucks  And she tries to be calm and a big girl to face what was happening with her parents, and for a girl at that age it was to much to handle. Spending time at her room and taking care of her mother every time something bad happened to her. One day she sees through the window and sees movement in the other house which is suppose to be abandoned. Little did she know that the person she saw on that house was a kid in her school. A kid that every student on the school hated. Not Lily, she took the first step to help him a little. I don't really know what to describe more, neither I'll give more details. But what I will say to all the ladies out there, that are going through tough times like this, SPEAK UP. Stand up for yourselves and your for the sake of your children. Don't ever let your fears or feelings for a person be the one thing that brings you to a grave or a hell in life. Be brave and strong.

323,"Actual Rating - 2.5 stars I think I'm outgrowing Abbi Glines books. This being the 12th book in the series it was way too predictable. Completely predictable actually. I was able to figure out the entire story right after the first chapter. Then again that's just me. When you have been so loyal to an author since her very first book you just tend to to want to read the rest. Yes, I've read 29 of her books since 2012. Now to the story. It was a bit too abrupt. Things just kept happening way too fast. For Example: ***SPOILER ALERT*** (not exactly, but keeping to goodread standards *winks*) Time taken for the reader to figure out Addy and Rose are the same person. Introduction of Franny to Captain. How quick leaving,, forgiving and forgetting happened after Captiain revealed his past to Addy/Rose And the good thing in the book. Something I actually liked... was that there was more story than... you know what.. I found it increasingly too much in Abbi's previous books. So good thing. Short, Quick read? This is it. *grins* UPDATE: I've listed it as dual pov, but there were one or two chapters by people other than the mains.

325,"Easy is what the author calls a Mature Young Adult or New Adult novel. I'm really liking these stories that feature college-aged people, but that's technically not really YA, so I agree with the author's categorization. I definitely wouldn't recommend Easy to, say, a 12-year-old (due to the subject matter--I'll elaborate below, but I want to put a trigger warning out there because the book deals with issues such as rape and other types of violence against women, which I didn't know going into the story but which some people might need to know upfront). Easy is about Jacqueline, who has somewhat romantically but mostly foolishly followed her high school boyfriend to the college of his choosing. She's a musician (upright bass) and while she should have attended a prestigious music conservatory, she has chosen to go to his college to be near him. Okay, not the end of the world...until said boyfriend dumps Jacqueline because he wants to ""sow his wild oats"" while he's still young, before pursuing his political aspirations. What. a. douche. Needless to say, Jacqueline is unnerved and stunned by the breakup--they'd been together for three years--but what I love about her character is that she doesn't allow the breakup to consume her. In other words, Jacqueline doesn't go all Bella Swan and stare at a spot on her wall for three months straight. It helps that she has an awesome best friend (who's also her roommate), Erin, who offers Jackie a remedy for her heartbreak: Operation Bad Boy Phase. There's this totally hot guy (aka Lucas) in Jacqueline's economics class who's been making moony eyes at her lately (it helps that she's no longer tethered to her ex, who's also in the class). Erin's advice: rebound time! Go for it! So your own wild oats, girl. Time's a-wastin'. (And here's where my review gets all spoilerish and gushy.) Erin convinces Jacqueline to attend a Halloween frat party, and when Jacqueline goes out to her truck to leave, this complete jerk Buck tries to rape her. She fights and tries to get away and is saved when Lucas shows up and beats the crap out of Buck. Okay, at this point I got slightly annoyed because I hate it when our heroine is a damsel who needs saving, but the book is SO MUCH MORE than that. The plot is very much about sexual assault and female empowerment (self-defense classes are always a good idea) and Jacqueline is actually a strong character who really develops over the course of the story. There's also a subplot that's very reminiscent of You've Got Mail, in which Jacqueline engages in email exchanges with her econ tutor, Landon, who may or may not be another Totally Hot Econ Guy--she's not sure because she's never met him. Okay, if you've seen You've Got Mail, I probably just spoiled this part for you, but if you don't pick up on who Landon is by the first email, you're not paying attention. Lucas. ah, Lucas. Such a tortured soul with secrets of his own. oh, and he's an artist, smart, funny, covered in tats, and...yeah, I support this Jacqueline + Lucas pairing very much. There are quite a few steamy scenes (and I mean STEAMY, which is why the book isn't appropriate for younger YA readers). Lucas is an awesomely written male character. He's not some stupid jerk alpha male who constantly needs to piss on his woman's leg in public to stake his claim on her. Lucas has his issues from the past (the revelation of how his mother died is heartbreaking) , but he doesn't treat Jacqueline like crap. He's incredibly considerate and kind toward her and encourages her to take charge of who she is, to empower herself, and not stay a victim. I was pretty sad when I finished Easy and found out that there's no sequel. I really would've loved to revisit these characters, who show significant development and who are a pleasure to read. I didn't find myself rolling my eyes constantly, the way I do sometimes at other books (*cough*Slammed*cough*) and the dialogue is believable. I appreciate that Lucas isn't one of those perfect Adonis dream guys with no flaws whatsoever (although Jacqueline does wax a bit [okay, a lot] poetic about his appearance from time to time). Likewise, Jacqueline actually grows over the course of the story--she starts out dependent on others, but by the end she's kind of fearless. Something I also appreciated--the attraction between Lucas and Jacqueline is intense, but I didn't get the sense it's ""insta-love"" at all, which is far too common in YA novels, I find. In fact, I really feel that there is room for more to the story...hint hint, please write a sequel, Tammara Webber! Your fans would love one! Update May 2014: She wrote a companion book from Lucas's POV!

326,"By the time I reached the half way point of the book, I truly believed there would be a book four, as I couldn't see how Catherine Doyle would resolve all the events with roughly 200 pages or so left. And, as I feared, the ending did have a rushed feel about it, rushed and even worse, not very realistic. [But what am I saying? This is a YA Mafia centric novel, so realism was never a part of this trilogy anyway]. Once again, I have to praise Millie, for me, the BEST character in the entire trilogy. To use a Britishism, she's brilliant! I just loved her personality (loyal, fun, smart, determined) especially when compared to that of Sophie (drama queen, unrealistic boy/girl flirting topics, self-pitying, a real drip). Why oh why couldn't the main character have been Millie?! That alone would have elevated the trilogy and earned more stars from this reviewer. But, we're stuck with Sophie, who, especially in Mafiosa, seemed to act more like a mafia princess, than BE a mafia princess. I understand her character was still reeling from the events of the previous novel, but Sophie seemed to be all over the place here. She veers between living the life of a normal teen girl (school, school dance, boy drama, occasional bratty behavior) and that of a Mob ""soldier"" (vengeful, hate-filled, thoughts full of violence and weaponry). And in both, she fails. I never really felt Sophie belonged in either world. She wasn't born into the Mafia life, so seemed to playact living in one. Then too, given her reality now, it was unbelievable having her continue to live the life of a normal girl. If Catherine Doyle wanted to portray a teen girl torn between two lives and two realities, she did a poor job of it. I didn't notice it in the first novel, but the British spelling of certain words (colour, favourite, tyre, etc.) makes me think the author is British. If so, it's a huge FAIL for me that British spelling and expression (""you want to give at me""?!) was used in a clearly American setting, in this case, Chicago. Almost all the characters in this trilogy were American born and raised, so it really took me out of the book when encountering Britishisms in this trilogy. The publisher should have edited those parts precisely because the characters and setting were not in Britain. So like I said, FAIL. Finally, although I liked the HEA ending, it was so eye-rollingly implausible, as well as utterly predictable. Did anyone doubt for one instance that M. Flores would turn out to be Evelina? C'mon, it was apparent the instant Sophie's father told her she could go to Colorado and someone there would help her, that the ""help"" would turn out to be the long-missing wife of Felice. Then too, of course I was rooting for Luca and Sophie to leave the Mob life and find their happily ever after fulfilling all their dreams, but the practical side of me says there's no way that can happen given what transpired in Mafiosa. When Luca decided not to go on the yacht, his explanation to Sophie came across as very spur of the moment. So how exactly would he and Sophie live? Where is their income? How would they get jobs? Did Sophie graduate from high school? Did they need to obtain fake documents for their new lives? So many unanswered questions, all legitimate. But no, we're treated to Sophie being surprised with tickets to see Phantom of the Opera as a birthday gift from Luca - and in Chicago no less! I always had the sense Sophie could do with more brain cells, but I didn't think Luca would be dumb enough to ever return to the scene of the crimes(plural!). The final novel and the trilogy as a whole left me feeling unsatisfied. I wanted more, and better character development for Sophie and more realism in showcasing how people could break away from a violent lifestyle. The only reasons I'm glad I read this trilogy were Millie and Luca. Everything/one else was meh to crap. Ultimately, I can't recommend this trilogy, even for Millie and Luca, fabulous as they were. These two weren't enough to overcome the problems throughout.",2,romance,"['time', 'reach', 'half', 'way', 'point', 'book', 'truly', 'believe', 'book', 'catherine', 'doyle', 'resolve', 'event', 'roughly', 'page', 'leave', 'fear', 'ending', 'rushed', 'feel', 'rushed', 'worse', 'realistic', 'say', 'ya', 'mafia', 'centric', 'novel', 'realism', 'trilogy', 'praise', 'millie', 'good', 'character', 'entire', 'trilogy', 'use', 'britishism', 'brilliant', 'love', 'personality', 'loyal', 'fun', 'smart', 'determined', 'especially', 'compare', 'sophie', 'drama', 'queen', 'unrealistic', 'boy', 'girl', 'flirting', 'topic', 'self', 'pitying', 'real', 'drip', 'oh', 'main_character', 'millie', 'elevate', 'trilogy', 'earn', 'star', 'reviewer', 'stick', 'sophie', 'especially', 'mafiosa', 'act', 'like', 'mafia', 'princess', 'mafia', 'princess', 'understand', 'character', 'reel', 'event', 'previous', 'novel', 'sophie', 'place', 'veer', 'live', 'life', 'normal', 'teen', 'girl', 'school', 'school', 'dance', 'boy', 'drama', 'occasional', 'bratty', 'behavior', 'mob', 'soldier', 'vengeful', 'hate', 'fill', 'thought', 'violence', 'weaponry', 'fail', 'feel', 'sophie', 'belong', 'world', 'bear', 'mafia', 'life', 'playact', 'live', 'give', 'reality', 'unbelievable', 'have', 'continue', 'live', 'life', 'normal', 'girl', 'catherine', 'doyle', 'want', 'portray', 'teen', 'girl', 'tear', 'life', 'reality', 'poor', 'job', 'notice', 'novel', 'british', 'spelling', 'certain', 'word', 'colour', 'favourite', 'tyre', 'etc', 'make', 'think', 'author', 'british', 'huge', 'fail', 'british', 'spelling', 'expression', 'want', 'clearly', 'american', 'setting', 'case', 'chicago', 'character', 'trilogy', 'american', 'bear', 'raise', 'take', 'book', 'encounter', 'britishism', 'trilogy', 'publisher', 'edit', 'part', 'precisely', 'character', 'setting', 'britain', 'like', 'say', 'fail', 'finally', 'like', 'hea', 'ending', 'eye', 'rollingly', 'implausible', 'utterly', 'predictable', 'doubt', 'instance', 'flores', 'turn', 'evelina', 'apparent', 'instant', 'sophie', 'father', 'tell', 'colorado', 'help', 'help', 'turn', 'long', 'miss', 'wife', 'felice', 'course', 'root', 'luca', 'sophie', 'leave', 'mob', 'life', 'find', 'happily', 'fulfil', 'dream', 'practical', 'say', 'way', 'happen', 'give', 'transpire', 'mafiosa', 'luca', 'decide', 'yacht', 'explanation', 'sophie', 'come', 'spur', 'moment', 'exactly', 'sophie', 'live', 'income', 'job', 'sophie', 'graduate', 'high_school', 'need', 'obtain', 'fake', 'document', 'new', 'life', 'unanswered_question', 'legitimate', 'treat', 'sophie', 'surprise', 'ticket', 'phantom', 'opera', 'birthday', 'gift', 'luca', 'chicago', 'sense', 'sophie', 'brain', 'cell', 'think', 'luca', 'dumb', 'return', 'scene', 'final', 'novel', 'trilogy', 'leave', 'feel', 'unsatisfied', 'want', 'well', 'character_development', 'sophie', 'realism', 'showcase', 'people', 'break', 'away', 'violent', 'lifestyle', 'reason', 'glad', 'read', 'trilogy', 'millie', 'luca', 'meh', 'crap', 'ultimately', 'recommend', 'trilogy', 'millie', 'luca', 'fabulous', 'overcome', 'problem']"
327,"Nila Weaver has just had the most successful night of her couture career. The fashion show went off without a hitch; the clothes she hand-sewed herself have been sold for thousands of dollars. She's a success. But there is something missing. She has lived a tightly controlled life and she has never really known why. Her father and twin brother Vaughan, argue it is all to keep her safe. Less than an hour after the show, she learns the truth. It's because she has always been pledged to another and he has shown up now, to collect. Jethro Hawk is the kind of man she'd have no trouble going with normally, but he hints that she won't be coming back. And her extra protective father just hands her across to him. She and her twin brother know nothing about all this. And then Jethro tears her dress off to make it easier for her to get on his motorbike. Nothing is what she thought it was. I don't get why this woman would be twenty four, an international designer who travels overseas and has a full professional life - and she has never had sex - other than the drunken fumbling of one guy. And she doesn't believe in self pleasure... huh? Why not? What other options does she have? Also, she has never even seen or held a cock. I repeat... she's twenty four. And works in the fashion industry. I'm going to go with ... how? She has her phone. She has friends and workmates. Her family (of two) cannot possibly stop her doing or seeing anything. Also why would you protect your daughter to then hand her over to these guys. It makes it almost worse. And it makes no sense. Photo-shopped evidence isn't real evidence. Not when they have cut and pasted Jethro's head on her father and brother - the only guys who have been near her. Weak. But it's enough to convince her. And I guess that is all they need. But it is one of those kind of stories where it just won't make sense and you can't expect it to. This isn't BDsM it's a slave story. There are no safe words here. The only way to remove her new collar is through death. The Weaver women are not here under any sort of meaningful consent; its duress over several generations. It's 'run away and I kill your whole family.' Note: running away might have actually stopped this at some generation. They can't enforce the deal without the women to enforce it on. And it also squicks me that the Hawks are all proud Englishmen and the Weavers are of Spanish (?) origin. So it's white men beating up blue-black haired ladies with dark skin. No. Just no. I am lawyer. I cannot believe that there would not have been some attempt by some of the last seven generations of the Weavers to fight this ridiculous contract. Contracts don't last forever even if they say they do. Her constant brain flips of 'I'm enjoying this I must be a whore' etc are frustrating in their ignorance. A rapist can give you an orgasm - it doesn't mean you consented. Orgasms are a physical reaction. It ends in a cliffhanger of a sort. There is no way she can run away naked, with no shoes from inside the Hawk family grounds. She doesn't even know how high the walls are. The hunting dogs have personalised electronic collars. And Jethro wants to hunt her. How silly are you, girl? This hits my squick buttons. I don't like the constant abuse stuff. They force her to do stuff and then thank her when she does, as if that replaces her consent. I know that works for some people, but not for me. And Jethro isn't her saviour; he brought her here. Why does she think he might care about her? And clearly 'kite' her phone sex dude is a member of the same family. Kites, hawks and eagles are all the same bird family. Jeez, Nila - Google it. 2 non consenting stars And 'observeillance' is not a word.

Mrs. Cass spent the entire book trying to exonerate Celeste and make her seem like a normal person with feelings, and then she died, and America barely gave her a second thought?! Ugh. Why?

330,"** spoiler alert ** (Thank you to Jeannie Moon, Tule Publishing and NetGalley for the opportunity to read an ARC for an honest review) His Forbidden Princess is a novella by Jeannie Moon and book four of the Royal Holiday series. A forbidden and second chance romance, the book stars Sophie and Ian who meet while Ian is a graduate fellow in England. They're in love, but when the truth about Sophie being a princess is revealed, they're separated until years later. After eight years, Ian is now a special agent who has volunteered to protect Sophie from terrorist during her visit to the U.S. After her family is attacked, he takes Sophie to his family home where they spend time together and reconnect. His Forbidden Princess is a cute short story that moves along well especially with the added action. I also liked the fact that Sophie loved Twinkies! :) The whole scene with Uncle John and him telling Sophie what a Twinkie was amusing. Overall, a must read for anyone who likes royals and second chance romances.

331,"I think I'm starting to realize that I like romances that include parent-child relationships, but I don't care for romances that are about parent-child relationships. This is definitely a book that let the actual ""romance"" take a back seat to the ""suddenly acquired child,"" and it just wasn't my sort of book. First of all, this book is shelved as an M/M romance here on GoodReads and Dreamspinner is widely a romance publisher, but this book really isn't a romance at all. In fact, despite being together since high school, Hen and Sam don't even really seem to like each other all that much. They're downright mean to one another most of the time! They seem a lot more like friends or brothers than lovers, broken only with Sam wanting to play with Hen's ""pecker"" once in a while. This isn't all bad--there's a sense of intimacy about them. They've always been close, always a twosome, always Hen-and-Sam, and I think that effortless connection is well-written. But we just never got the idea that they made a very good romantic duo, even if they made excellent fathers. The drama of two gay men trying to take care of a young disabled child in the conservative South is not lost on me, but it didn't feel like something I haven't read before. It feels like an exercise in futility--Hen has to bite his tongue and turn the other way at the endless abuse, homophobia, racism, and Islamophobia of his town because he wants custody of his nephew who, it turns out, it also his younger brother due to his deceased father raping his sister when she was 13 . He subjects himself to mass because of his faith, but the church (save for a kind nun) just shuns him at every turn and makes him feel unwanted. It's more a story of ""let's see how much we can make these men suffer"" than anything. Maybe I'm just jaded. Maybe I'm exhausted by it. But is anyone else just tired of these narratives? But just because I didn't like the story doesn't mean Wilgus is a bad writer. He has a great knack for dialogue and setting. Even when his minor characters make me want to scream, they feel real, and there's a deprecating sense of humor about it all. I feel like it is distinctly southern in a way I will never understand. This isn't my favorite read of 2017, and if you want a light romance with a no-strings-attached HEA, this won't be for you.

332,"Today I was watching Rafael Nadal play (and annihilate -- sigh) my homeboy Milos Raonic in the Rogers Cup, and I found myself unable to stop contemplating his ass. The boy fits his shorts well, I tell you. Nummy. The rest of Rafa does not work for me, though. The headband, the hair, the nasally voice. In fact, I can't think of one tennis player who entirely does do it for me -- bits and pieces, yes, such as Rafa's ass, Roddick's legs, Djokovic's style, Federer's money... (This does make me a jerk. If I heard a guy saying this about women, I'd probably get in a fistfight.) Nope, only one that's appealed is Jonathan Rhys Meyers in Match Point. But J. Kenner (and apparently Woody Allen) gets the potential of tennis players -- what the combination of rock-hard calves, fierce determination, and millions of dollars in winnings can do to a girl. Hence Damien Stark, former tennis star, current billionaire, always gorgeous. This is the third and final instalment of Kenner's Stark trilogy. It begins with Damien on trial for his coach's murder well after the fact. Nikki is begging him to reveal his history with his coach, assuring him it will solve all his problems (not entirely sure how...), but Damien's adamant that he wants his past kept very, very private. The trial is destroying both of them. The rest of the book is, like the other two, basically just angst, sex, repeat. Lots of angst, tons o' sex. Like Sylvia Day's Crossfire series but with more sex, I swear to god. Normally I'm totally on board with that, but -- and I can't even believe I'm writing this -- I did get to a point where I said, ""Geez, again? Really?"" Although the sex stayed interesting, so I kind of got over that. The angst, not so much. Maybe I'm just tired of Nikki and Damien and all the bloody drama. (Once again, much as I am with the Crossfire series.) I've never been a huge fan of Nikki, although I've tried. I just don't understand how she gets anything done ever, nor Damien for that matter. And she's so judgy when it comes to her friends. Always judging. Damien's too much of an enigma for me, so I can't get into him either. Fans of the series will probably enjoy this, as will fans of lots and lots of sex. I was kind of the former, and I thought I was the latter, but I wasn't a huge fan of this book. (Also, I think I'm completely burnt out on first person.) It was okay, it wasn't exactly disappointing, but it felt a bit like work. Lila Reviewed from ARC.

333,"Review also posted on my blog at: Kala's Book Blog I have really mixed feelings about this book. The first half is almost a clone of Beautiful Disaster with Jack acting like a huge player who ""never sleeps with the same girl twice"" and gets in fights a lot (aka Travis). Cassie acts exactly like Abby as the girl who can resist him, but not really, and he instantly falls for her. They start dating quickly and he becomes possessively obsessed with Cassie. He even gives her an arbitrary nick name the first time they meet - Kitten (which makes as much sense as Pigeon, but at least is something cute instead of the cockroach of birds). Jack also beats people up, treats every other girl (EXCEPT Cassie and her best friend) like a slut. Speaking of the best friend, Cassie's best friend is a clone of the BFF in Beautiful Disaster too. She fluctuates between warning Cassie off of Jack and telling Cassie to forgive Jack's constant bad behavior. Despite the similarities to Beautiful Disaster, I still enjoyed the story for the most part. The book starts deviating in plotline towards the middle when Jack gets drafted (for baseball). Major spoilers after this point! Jack cheats on Cassie, which I don't understand at all. I know he was drunk, but he was completely uninterested in this girl who won't leave him alone yet he KEEPS drinking until he's so drunk he goes home with her. Of course, the girl ends up pregnant. Then Jack, who is the biggest moron ever, decides he has to marry the girl. He can't stand her, is in love with Cassie (who is willing to forgive him despite him cheating AND getting a girl pregnant), but he insists on torturing everyone by marrying the girl. AND HE DOES IT. Despite Cassie coming down the day before to beg him not to. That conversation broke my heart and the way he treated Cassie during that conversation, especially when the other girl shows up, was unforgivable. Completely unforgivable. But then, of course, the girl was faking the pregnancy (and Jack, the biggest moron ever, can't wait to see a pregnancy test or a PATERNITY TEST... this girl is a huge slut and he doesn't wait for a paternity test?? So Jack dumps her and waits six months to beg for Cassie back. I admit he did it in a cute way, but I didn't care at that point. He was not redeemable at that point. He just wasn't. So I couldn't feel like it was a happy ending, despite it being a happy ending. I was impressed by the author's writing style though. The book was well edited, has a nice cover, and was formatted well. Though I had some issues with the story itself, the book flowed really well and was a quick and easy read.

334,"Silly me... I thought this would be a standalone book. I just read that this is a 5-novel series so hopefully I only have to wait one year for the series to be complete! I thought this was another great book in this series - this series has become one of my favorites ever! Eadlyn is 7 minutes older than her twin brother, Ahren. Which makes her next in line to be queen of Illea, a position she has been groomed for her entire life. Under the rule of her parents, Maxon and America, the caste system has been wiped out and everyone is now free to create their own lives. But a generation later there is still a lot of unrest in Illea. Her parents desperately need a distraction while they try to figure out what is going on. Eadlyn agrees to a Selection as long as she can refuse all the candidates in the end. And that is her plan because she doesn't plan to get married. Eadlyn starts out selfish, but as she interacts with more people and starts letting her defenses down, we see her vulnerability. She is extremely loyal to those close to her and to her country and she has to go through some tough challenges, which all help shape her and help her to start seeing herself as others see her. As for the 35 young men, I definitely have my favorite that I am rooting for. (I am Team Kile)  But there are 3 that I think have a great shot at winning her heart (and she's already hinted that she knows which young man it is, but it wasn't revealed to us in this book) so I can't wait to see how everything resolves in what I hope is the final book (please don't make me wait for a 6th book)!

336,"4 crazy mystery stars! The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, an exceptionally high-rated book in the Hercule Poirot series, lives up to its fame. I intended to finish this book in a day, as a part of a self-readathon, but I'm glad that I didn't stick to that. I could enjoy the book slowly to its fullest, which might not have been possible otherwise. The book starts off with a suicide and a murder. Plus, a mega congregation of characters, each of which added to the suspicion. The mystery builds up slowly in multiple tiers and is unfolded progressively by the Belgian detective with seamless method and precision. Lies, secrets, blackmail- each unravel under the strain of his keen observation, be it inanimate objects, like the occasional chair displaced in a corner of the room or the animated looks on many a face that crossed him by. He sets a new standard with his old-fashioned, curious, odd little ideas, all of which seem irrelevant to begin with, but soon fit in the major scheme of things. He searched for an alibi for each of the people connected with the case, holding them up as potential suspects till the end, never waving anyone into his full confidence. As has always been a reason for me liking Christie, she endeavors to elucidate Poirot's order of investigation in a detailed way, even here. That's something I admire in authors, and she comes in the list naturally. Reasons why I didn't add another star is because the end felt a bit rushed. A plausible reason might be because the narrator himself was the culprit and hence things were different. Poirot kept the ultimate revelation for the end, which though an indication of his supreme caution, kept a major part of the story obscure from the reader. Also because Poirot himself offered to let the man assist him in this case, people took the wise old man's decision for granted and scratched out one major figure from the whole picture. So many things which one might associate the murderer with never occur in the potholes of the story because of this reason. Not until Poirot reveals the meticulous working of his gray cells. When I tried placing my finger on the wrongdoer, the mysterious telephone call to Dr. Sheppard never fitted with any of them. No matter how close on track I was, that never brought me closer to the major discovery. Alas Christie! You win. Yet again. Also, I had issues with the motive. It wasn't THAT strong enough to imply killing as an ultimate option. Till now, all of Christie's murderers have had some very profound purpose behind a grave thing like murder. This one was less justified, in comparison. And Hastings! I skipped the previous book, an anthology of sorts, so unsure of why he needed to go away this abruptly. I missed him dearly, right from the very onset of the story. Young man, whatever you might be doing in Argentina, come down right now! This is unfair, Poirot is crippled without your pompous ideas, and so are we fellow mortals! Overall a great read. Recommended highly. 4 stars in all.",4,thriller,"['crazy', 'mystery', 'star', 'murder', 'roger', 'ackroyd', 'exceptionally', 'high', 'rate', 'book', 'hercule', 'poirot', 'series', 'live', 'fame', 'intend', 'finish', 'book', 'day', 'self', 'readathon', 'glad', 'stick', 'enjoy', 'book', 'slowly', 'full', 'possible', 'book', 'start', 'suicide', 'murder', 'plus', 'mega', 'congregation', 'character', 'add', 'suspicion', 'mystery', 'build', 'slowly', 'multiple', 'tier', 'unfold', 'progressively', 'belgian', 'detective', 'seamless', 'method', 'precision', 'lie', 'secret', 'unravel', 'strain', 'keen', 'observation', 'inanimate', 'object', 'like', 'occasional', 'chair', 'displace', 'corner', 'room', 'animated', 'look', 'face', 'cross', 'set', 'new', 'standard', 'old', 'fashioned', 'curious', 'odd', 'little', 'idea', 'irrelevant', 'begin', 'soon', 'fit', 'major', 'scheme', 'thing', 'search', 'alibi', 'people', 'connect', 'case', 'hold', 'potential', 'suspect', 'till_end', 'wave', 'confidence', 'reason', 'like', 'christie', 'endeavor', 'elucidate', 'poirot', 'order', 'investigation', 'detailed', 'way', 'admire', 'author', 'come', 'list', 'naturally', 'reason', 'add', 'star', 'end', 'feel', 'bit', 'rushed', 'plausible', 'reason', 'narrator', 'culprit', 'thing', 'different', 'poirot', 'keep', 'ultimate', 'revelation', 'end', 'indication', 'supreme', 'caution', 'keep', 'major', 'story', 'obscure', 'reader', 'poirot', 'offer', 'let', 'man', 'assist', 'case', 'people', 'take', 'wise', 'old', 'man', 'decision', 'grant', 'scratch', 'major', 'figure', 'picture', 'thing', 'associate', 'murderer', 'occur', 'pothole', 'story', 'reason', 'poirot', 'reveal', 'meticulous', 'working', 'gray', 'cell', 'try', 'place', 'finger', 'wrongdoer', 'mysterious', 'telephone', 'sheppard', 'fit', 'matter', 'close', 'track', 'bring', 'close', 'major', 'discovery', 'alas', 'christie', 'win', 'issue', 'motive', 'strong', 'imply', 'killing', 'ultimate', 'option', 'till', 'christie', 'murderer', 'profound', 'purpose', 'grave', 'thing', 'like', 'murder', 'justified', 'comparison', 'hastings', 'skip', 'previous', 'book', 'anthology', 'sort', 'unsure', 'need', 'away', 'abruptly', 'miss', 'dearly', 'right', 'onset', 'story', 'young', 'man', 'argentina', 'come', 'right', 'unfair', 'poirot', 'cripple', 'pompous', 'idea', 'fellow', 'mortal', 'overall', 'great', 'read', 'recommend', 'highly', 'star']"
337,"(2.5 of 5 stars) This feels like a standalone novella which the publishers pressured Spencer-Fleming into expanding to novel-length and cramming into this series, for reasons I can't even fathom. I can't think of any other reason why Clare and Russ would have so little screentime here, while the vast majority of time is devoted to a bunch of hapless characters bumbling around in the woods. In different hands it might have been a decent murder mystery/comedy - there are so many close shaves and near-misses as people wander into scenes, leap to all the wrong conclusions, and then pass the next incoming schmuck on their way out again, unnoticed. But instead it's played totally straight, with far too many convenient coincidences, and the mystery pretty much solves itself with no outside involvement whatsoever. I won't even get into the ending, except to say that the motivation for blowing up the hotel made no sense , and also suuuuure, Russ, what could possibly go wrong with that plan ?",2,thriller,"['star', 'feel', 'like', 'standalone', 'novella', 'publisher', 'pressure', 'spencer', 'fleming', 'expand', 'novel', 'length', 'cram', 'series', 'reason', 'fathom', 'think', 'reason', 'clare', 'russ', 'little', 'screentime', 'vast', 'majority', 'time', 'devote', 'bunch', 'hapless', 'character', 'bumble', 'wood', 'different', 'hand', 'decent', 'murder_mystery', 'comedy', 'close', 'shave', 'near', 'miss', 'people', 'wander', 'scene', 'leap', 'wrong', 'conclusion', 'pass', 'incoming', 'schmuck', 'way', 'unnoticed', 'instead', 'play', 'totally', 'straight', 'far', 'convenient', 'coincidence', 'mystery', 'pretty', 'solve', 'outside', 'involvement', 'whatsoever', 'will', 'ending', 'motivation', 'blow', 'hotel', 'sense', 'suuuuure', 'russ', 'possibly', 'wrong', 'plan']"
338,"Wow--great book. It sucked me in and didn't let go until I finished. This is writing at its best--powerful, persuasive, and textured--and I reveled in the author's ability to create a plot that both intrigued me but also got me emotionally involved. It had me on the edge of my seat. I was so engrossed; I finished Mud Vein in just over a day. First Thoughts: The situation the main characters, Senna and Isaac find themselves in is a strange, twisted but intriguing setup. Senna's story was heartbreaking, but she is cuckoo--no denying that--still, I loved how the author brought us through Senna's psychosis. I felt it. Lived it. Breathed it ... loved the all-encompassing, macabre, detailed effects of it, and emotional dramatic arches it took me through. Middle Thoughts: As much as I sympathized with Senna's situation, I didn't really get why she was so closed off. Though she had difficult relationships with both parents, they didn't sound abusive, and neither did her relationship with former-lover, Nick. I didn't exactly understand what made her like she was. Her resistance to letting Isaac in and allowing herself to trust frustrated me. At times, I felt beat up and tired of Senna's self-inflicted barrier, and I had to put the book down for a brief break from it. I craved for her to stop being silent and give Isaac some of her words. If I had one complaint, it would be that I would've liked to be more convinced of what led Senna to her state of complete emotional remoteness, prior to the rape and cancer . I tend to think she was OCD or mildly autistic. It didn't take anything away from the story, but if it had been explained a bit more in depth, I might have identified with, and had more patience, for her character. Final Thoughts: I found myself wanting Senna and Isaac to end up together, despite the fact that he was much too kind, much too good to be forever paired with her dysfunction. As good for her as he was, he deserved more. My over-logical, analytical thinking aside, this book is one of the best I've read in a while. It's easy to tell when a book really affects me--besides the fact that I ignore my work, family and life for the duration of reading it, I think about the characters even after I've finished reading the book. The bonus effect is that good writing is inspiring. It makes me want to get writing.

339,"It's entirely possible that this anthology is more brilliant than it appears because I'm not familiar with the ACD canon and so stories that appeared to have little relationship with Sherlock Holmes (including an entire entry by someone writing about the fact that they didn't know anything about Holmes) are actually clever allusions to canon that I just missed. Or not. I did get that some were retellings of ACD stories with other people standing in for Holmes and Watson (why, I don't know). There were two stories that stood out. One is Neil Gaiman's The Case of Death and Honey (full disclosure: I'm a fan of Gaiman's other work). His dealt directly with Sherlock Holmes. I liked his portrayal of Sherlock's relationship with Mycroft. I also liked his suggestion of how Mycroft could have kept the Empire running on his own but that without it him it would crumble. I also liked his portrayal of John Watson fading away as he got older and suffered losses. And I definitely buy the idea that were Sherlock to discover how to reverse aging or how to make himself immortal, he'd do it to John without telling him first). The other was The Case That Holmes Lost by Charles Todd. It dealt with some of Doyle's ambivalence about Holmes and an intersection between (fictional) Doyle's life with Holmes. I'd like to read more about Doyle, I know he had something of a love/hate relationship with his creation.",3,thriller,"['entirely', 'possible', 'anthology', 'brilliant', 'appear', 'familiar', 'acd', 'canon', 'story', 'appear', 'little', 'relationship', 'sherlock_holmes', 'include', 'entire', 'entry', 'write', 'fact', 'know', 'holmes', 'actually', 'clever', 'allusion', 'canon', 'miss', 'retelling', 'acd', 'story', 'people', 'stand', 'holmes_watson', 'know', 'story', 'stand', 'neil_gaiman', 'case', 'death', 'honey', 'disclosure', 'fan', 'gaiman', 'work', 'deal', 'directly', 'sherlock_holmes', 'like', 'portrayal', 'sherlock', 'relationship', 'mycroft', 'like', 'suggestion', 'mycroft', 'keep', 'empire', 'run', 'crumble', 'like', 'portrayal', 'john', 'watson', 'fade', 'away', 'get', 'old', 'suffer', 'loss', 'definitely', 'buy', 'idea', 'sherlock', 'discover', 'reverse', 'aging', 'immortal', 'john', 'tell', 'case', 'holmes', 'lose', 'charles', 'todd', 'deal', 'doyle', 'ambivalence', 'holmes', 'intersection', 'fictional', 'doyle', 'life', 'holmes', 'like', 'read', 'doyle', 'know', 'love', 'hate', 'relationship', 'creation']"
340,"A moment of silence please, for the first book in this series that seemed to be the beginning of a promising series. I think I may have figured out Jess Lindsay's problem: he can concoct interesting scenarios and outlines for plots. But his ability to write characters is almost non-existent. To combat this, he began by writing about a character who is a self-confessed 'non-human'. He has a girlfriend/wife whose primary function is to stay home and cook, be entirely naive and clueless, and occasionally talk to Dexter in a series of half sentences of ""Really, Dexter?"" and ""Oh, but the kids..."" (for real, the number of times Rita manages to get a full sentence out, and one that doesn't just paint her as a dithering caricature is... a very low number). And then we have Dexter's sister Deborah, whose only character trait is that she likes being a police officer and doesn't like looking feminine. And she says fuck a lot. (and spends a LOT of time at work). The rest of the cast are more or less invisible extras, with a couple of 'regulars' chucked in who has one line personalities (Vince Masouka likes sex jokes. That is his entire personality, and will be reaffirmed at least three times in each novel.) So, here we come to Dexter Is Delicious. The fifth novel in the series. And it is actually a very good novel... if we ignore the context of the preceding four novels, and those pesky characters. Right at the start, we have Dexter, who is now madly in love with his new daughter. I can understand this, and it could have been interesting to see how Dexter's world view shifted entirely with the existence of daughter - and it WAS interesting - until he became kind of obsessed, and incredibly fickle.I'm never going to kill again. I'm going to kill to protect Lily. He can't seem to make his mind up - almost as though Jeff Lindsay couldn't make his mind up (as he couldn't quite make his mind up with how to deal with child murderers in the previous book). We also have Dexter suddenly Feeling Things for other humans. He feels things and emotions, which is slightly weird after reading him berate the entirety of human existence for four books. And now let's start on  Brian. This could have been an amazing plot device, if it had been handled interestingly. Well, to be honest... if it had been handled ANY way, and if ANYTHING had happened other than what DID happen. Dexter just invites him in for a cup of coffee? And seems surprised when Rita takes to him? Does Dexter not think that, sine his entire life has been built on faking niceness, maybe his brother has done the same? And then rather than warning Rita about Brian (EVEN WHEN HE TAKES ASTOR AND CODY OUT TO KILL) Dexter just... lets it happen. No reaction. Why, Dexter? Why, Jess Lindsay? Why would that happen and why does it happen? And then the big twist at the end, which.. well no, was that even meant to be a twist? It was so painfully obvious from the very first mention of  Brian . But even after this unshocking reveal, the finale o the book was ridiculous. A serial murderer is in a gang of cannibals, and they have 3 police officers as hostages. I can believe that Brian would help Dexter, due to his sibling bond. But then he lets Chutsky go too? And he lets DEBORAH go? The last time they met, Brian tried to kill Deborah - he tried to get DEXTER to kill Deborah. And now he just lets her go? I don't buy it. I also don't buy that Dexter is happy to then just let Brian join the family with no worries. THIS IS BRIAN THE MURDERER. THIS IS BRIAN WHO TRIED TO MURDER YOUR SISTER A FEW YEARS AGO. Now suddenly, he has done a 180 and decided to help Deborah escape her kidnapping, and Dexter does a 180 and just forgets that a while ago he was feeling human emotion for Deborah, and is happy to let her attempted murderer join his family. And let's just hope Deb never finds out!! What a great plan. I mean, do Rita and Deborah never talk? (Probably not, Rita just faffs about the kids and burning dinner, because that is all her character is.) And then there is Deborah, and bless Jeff Lindsay for attempting to inject some character development into her. But... motherhood? Into Deborah? I would say that it seems highly unlike her character, but that would probably depend on her having had a character for the last four novels. The final thing that really got me was Dexter's extramarital sex scene. Dexter on ecstasy was never something I wished to see, and his description of love and beauty was more nauseating than his odes to Lily-Anne whilst sober. And that was almost as nauseating as the thought than he then had sex with an 18 year old, and almost as nauseating as Jeff Lindsay playing the 'girl threatens to call rape' card. Really, I am sure that there were a range of things that COULD have happened during their imprisonment that she could have held over Dexter's head. Instead, we got a whole load of nausea. And then, aside form our regular characters acting bizarre, we also get a whole load of new characters. Deb has a now partner, there are some random new sergeants, some FBI agents. And with little to no character description (""Deke thinks everybody loves him"") they are really nothing more than extras. I especially like the female FBI agent who, in one throwaway sentence was suspicious of Dexter and his activities, and then 50 pages into the book is never mentioned again. Hooray for developed characters! It also occurred to me how often Dexter talks about cliches. Whether discussing that 'usually this cliche is wrong, but here it is!' or 'this cliche is totally true!' he just can't get enough of proving that he knows which things are cliches and which things are not. (Hint for Jeff Lindsay: constantly talking about cliches in a disapproving manner is not really any more acceptable than constantly using cliches) So yes. Apart from character issues, the plotline in this really IS good. And if it were a standalone novel, I would probably rate it 4 stars. Maybe 5 if it were a standalone novel with fleshed out characters. Jeff Lindsay CAN create good stories, but maybe it is time to stick to standalone novels where you don't need to build a whole cast of consistent characters. {{read 20/07/14}}",3,thriller,"['moment', 'silence', 'book', 'series', 'beginning', 'promising', 'series', 'think', 'figure', 'jess', 'lindsay', 'problem', 'concoct', 'interesting', 'scenario', 'outline', 'plot', 'ability', 'write', 'character', 'non', 'existent', 'combat', 'begin', 'write', 'character', 'self', 'confess', 'non', 'human', 'girlfriend', 'wife', 'primary', 'function', 'stay', 'home', 'cook', 'entirely', 'naive', 'clueless', 'occasionally', 'talk', 'dexter', 'series', 'half', 'sentence', 'dexter', 'oh', 'kid', 'real', 'number', 'time', 'rita', 'manage', 'sentence', 'paint', 'dithering', 'caricature', 'low', 'number', 'dexter', 'sister', 'deborah', 'character', 'trait', 'like', 'police_officer', 'like', 'look', 'feminine', 'say', 'fuck', 'lot', 'spend', 'lot', 'time', 'work', 'rest', 'cast', 'invisible', 'extra', 'couple', 'regular', 'chuck', 'line', 'personality', 'vince', 'masouka', 'like', 'sex', 'joke', 'entire', 'personality', 'reaffirm', 'time', 'novel', 'come', 'dexter', 'delicious', 'fifth', 'novel', 'series', 'actually', 'good', 'novel', 'ignore', 'context', 'precede', 'novel', 'pesky', 'character', 'right', 'start', 'dexter', 'madly', 'love', 'new', 'daughter', 'understand', 'interesting', 'dexter', 'world', 'view', 'shift', 'entirely', 'existence', 'daughter', 'interesting', 'kind', 'obsessed', 'incredibly', 'fickle', 'go', 'kill', 'go', 'kill', 'protect', 'lily', 'mind', 'jeff_lindsay', 'mind', 'mind', 'deal', 'child', 'murderer', 'previous', 'book', 'dexter', 'suddenly', 'feel', 'thing', 'human', 'feel', 'thing', 'emotion', 'slightly', 'weird', 'read', 'berate', 'entirety', 'human', 'existence', 'book', 'let', 'start', 'brian', 'amazing', 'plot_device', 'handle', 'interestingly', 'honest', 'handle', 'way', 'happen', 'happen', 'dexter', 'invite', 'cup', 'coffee', 'surprised', 'rita', 'take', 'dexter', 'think', 'sine', 'entire', 'life', 'build', 'fake', 'niceness', 'maybe', 'brother', 'warn', 'rita', 'brian', 'take', 'astor', 'cody', 'kill', 'dexter', 'let', 'happen', 'reaction', 'dexter', 'jess', 'lindsay', 'happen', 'happen', 'big', 'twist', 'end', 'mean', 'twist', 'painfully', 'obvious', 'mention', 'brian', 'unshocking', 'reveal', 'finale', 'o', 'book', 'ridiculous', 'serial', 'murderer', 'gang', 'cannibal', 'police_officer', 'hostage', 'believe', 'brian', 'help', 'dexter', 'sibling', 'bond', 'let', 'chutsky', 'let', 'deborah', 'time', 'meet', 'brian', 'try', 'kill', 'deborah', 'try', 'dexter', 'kill', 'deborah', 'let', 'buy', 'buy', 'dexter', 'happy', 'let', 'brian', 'join', 'family', 'worry', 'brian', 'murderer', 'brian', 'try', 'murder', 'sister', 'year_ago', 'suddenly', 'decide', 'help', 'deborah', 'escape', 'kidnapping', 'dexter', 'forget', 'ago', 'feel', 'human', 'emotion', 'deborah', 'happy', 'let', 'attempt', 'murderer', 'join', 'family', 'let', 'hope', 'deb', 'find', 'great', 'plan', 'mean', 'rita', 'deborah', 'talk', 'probably', 'rita', 'faff', 'kid', 'burn', 'dinner', 'character', 'deborah', 'bless', 'jeff_lindsay', 'attempt', 'inject', 'character_development', 'motherhood', 'deborah', 'highly', 'unlike', 'character', 'probably', 'depend', 'having', 'character', 'novel', 'final', 'thing', 'get', 'dexter', 'extramarital', 'sex_scene', 'dexter', 'ecstasy', 'wish', 'description', 'love', 'beauty', 'nauseating', 'ode', 'lily', 'anne', 'whilst', 'sober', 'nauseating', 'thought', 'sex', 'year_old', 'nauseating', 'jeff_lindsay', 'play', 'girl', 'threaten', 'rape', 'card', 'sure', 'range', 'thing', 'happen', 'imprisonment', 'hold', 'dexter', 'head', 'instead', 'get', 'load', 'nausea', 'aside', 'form', 'regular', 'character', 'act', 'bizarre', 'load', 'new', 'character', 'deb', 'partner', 'random', 'new', 'sergeant', 'fbi', 'agent', 'little', 'character', 'description', 'deke', 'think', 'everybody', 'love', 'extra', 'especially', 'like', 'female', 'fbi', 'agent', 'throwaway', 'sentence', 'suspicious', 'dexter', 'activity', 'page', 'book', 'mention', 'hooray', 'developed', 'character', 'occur', 'dexter', 'talk', 'cliche', 'discuss', 'usually', 'cliche', 'wrong', 'cliche', 'totally', 'true', 'prove', 'know', 'thing', 'cliche', 'thing', 'hint', 'jeff_lindsay', 'constantly', 'talk', 'cliche', 'disapproving', 'manner', 'acceptable', 'constantly', 'cliche', 'yes', 'apart', 'character', 'issue', 'plotline', 'good', 'standalone_novel', 'probably', 'rate', 'star', 'maybe', 'standalone_novel', 'flesh', 'character', 'jeff_lindsay', 'create', 'good', 'story', 'maybe', 'time', 'stick', 'standalone_novel', 'need', 'build', 'cast', 'consistent', 'character', 'read']"
341,"Disclaimer: I listened to the audio book, so I won't be commenting on the author's style or sentence structure. I can, however, critique the plot, character development, pacing, and other literary elements. Quick, non-spoiler review: It was entertaining and it had me thinking about all the things I've done, all the decisions made by my parents and me and others in my life, that made me this version of myself in this world. Quantum physics is always a fun and freaky concept and I do tend to gravitate towards stories that center around alternate realities. As entertaining as it was, the ending left me feeling unfulfilled. It left me a little angry. The characters were often frustrating, especially the female characters who catered to the main character and did not seem to have much personality aside from being smitten with the main character (so much that both Amanda and Daniella risked their lives to save/be with him). Often I found myself whispering, ""Jason, you IDIOT!"" because the way he conducted himself much of the time was, well, moronic. For a character who is described as a physicist who would have revolutionized his field of study, he didn't have a lot of common sense. I predicted a lot of outcomes right away, which isn't always a bad thing, but it did make it less exciting for me in the second half of the novel. Overall, I give it three stars, because it was fun most of the time, but disappointing in other aspects which I will go into detail about below, if you don't mind spoilers. Nit-picky review:  I had some issues with Jason as a character. At first I was rooting for him - I desperately wanted him to find his wife and son again. After he went to the apocalyptic world riddled with disease, AND THEN STAYED TO GIVE ""HIS"" WIFE MORPHINE, EXPOSING HIM AND EVERYONE ELSE (POTENTIALLY INFINITE WORLDS) TO A DEADLY BUBONIC PLAGUE EBOLA COCKTAIL VIRUS, I stopped rooting for him because it became very clear to me that he didn't care whose life or lives he would sacrifice to save Daniella. Under normal circumstances, I would be able to understand that and sympathize, if he, ya know, weren't this hot shot smarty farty scientist. But he is supposed to be somewhat aware of what his actions could lead to. He is insightful at times, knowing exactly what the consequences of his actions are, and at other times he is completely oblivious, arrogant, and downright reckless. That was a huge problem for me. I also want to know why the H E double hockey sticks he didn't destroy the confounded box of doom! I could understand why this course of action was not attempted if the author explained it couldn't be destroyed, but the thought never even crosses Jason's mind. Another aspect of the book I took issue with is the way the women are written. Amanda gives up literally everything to save Jason and is then written out of the book. I hate it when authors chicken out of giving a character we have grown to admire or love a real ending. And Daniella Daniella Daniella. Where to begin? She seems like every guy's dream girl... the manic pixie dream girl the main character gets to marry and keep. She's beautiful, from a far off land, an artist, endlessly compassionate, understanding, and self-sacrificing. Jason is so obsessed with her that he often forgets about their son, who was seemingly injected into this narrative as a plot device. She is everything but strong-willed. She is the damsel to be saved, starting with the moment her and Jason met at a party. Jason ""saves"" her from a notorious womanizer and then swoops in to snatch her up for himself. Le sigh. Jason is the epitome of the ""nice guy"" all women know a little too well. I couldn't help rolling my eyes as the actor described exactly how that scene went down. Later Daniella says, ""Jason, do you remember when we met and you saved me from that guy?"" Why are you reminding me of this Daniella? WHY DOES THE AUTHOR INSIST ON SHOVING THIS DAMSEL IN DISTRESS TROPE DOWN MY THROAT. It's not romantic, it's trite and annoying. Stop it! Furthermore, I will never understand why Daniella doesn't tell this guy she's had enough when hundreds of Jasons threaten their lives. She leaves everything - her whole world - to be with him, not giving a hoot about how it will affect their son. What? Is her love for him seriously that delusional? She barely questions their final decision before they plunge into the abyss of the box! I feel like there wasn't enough character building for that to seem realistic. I also found myself wishing we spent a little more time in the first world, or any of the other worlds really. The world hopping started to feel like Groundhog's day, which may have been the author's intention, but the tactic didn't allow for much development in any world Jason explored, which is something I personally would have liked to experience. Another thing I'm curious about: how did Jason killing Jasons not rip a hole in the space-time continuum or something? I'm no physicist, but I feel like that would have dire consequences. Maybe not. But the science could have been explained a little better, for me at least. I do like that the ending was ambiguous regarding what happens to the Dessens, but there were definitely some loose ends that leave me wondering about the state of the multiverse. Also, is that awful disease going to spread to other worlds and just completely obliterate all of existence? I sort of like to think that happens because if nothing exists, Jason doesn't exist either, and that's just fine with me. I'm sure there are more questions I will have about this novel that I would like to delve into, but for now this concludes my review.",3,thriller,"['disclaimer', 'listen_audio', 'book', 'will', 'comment', 'author', 'style', 'sentence', 'structure', 'critique', 'plot', 'character_development', 'pacing', 'literary', 'element', 'quick', 'non', 'spoiler', 'review', 'entertaining', 'think', 'thing', 'decision', 'parent', 'life', 'version', 'world', 'quantum', 'physics', 'fun', 'freaky', 'concept', 'tend', 'gravitate', 'story', 'center', 'alternate_reality', 'entertaining', 'ending', 'leave', 'feel', 'unfulfilled', 'leave', 'little', 'angry', 'character', 'frustrating', 'especially', 'female', 'character', 'cater', 'main_character', 'personality', 'aside', 'smite', 'main_character', 'amanda', 'daniella', 'risk', 'life', 'save', 'find', 'whisper', 'jason', 'idiot', 'way', 'conduct', 'time', 'moronic', 'character', 'describe', 'physicist', 'revolutionize', 'field', 'study', 'lot', 'common', 'sense', 'predict', 'lot', 'outcome', 'right_away', 'bad', 'thing', 'exciting', 'second_half', 'novel', 'overall', 'star', 'fun', 'time', 'disappointing', 'aspect', 'detail', 'mind', 'spoiler', 'nit', 'picky', 'review', 'issue', 'jason', 'character', 'root', 'desperately', 'want', 'find', 'wife', 'son', 'go', 'apocalyptic', 'world', 'riddle', 'disease', 'stay', 'wife', 'morphine', 'expose', 'potentially', 'infinite', 'world', 'deadly', 'bubonic', 'plague', 'ebola', 'cocktail', 'virus', 'stop', 'root', 'clear', 'care', 'life', 'life', 'sacrifice', 'save', 'daniella', 'normal', 'circumstance', 'able', 'understand', 'sympathize', 'ya', 'know', 'hot', 'shot', 'smarty', 'farty', 'scientist', 'suppose', 'somewhat', 'aware', 'action', 'lead', 'insightful', 'time', 'know', 'exactly', 'consequence', 'action', 'time', 'completely', 'oblivious', 'arrogant', 'downright', 'reckless', 'huge', 'problem', 'want', 'know', 'h', 'e', 'double', 'hockey', 'stick', 'destroy', 'confounded', 'box', 'doom', 'understand', 'course', 'action', 'attempt', 'author', 'explain', 'destroy', 'thought', 'cross', 'jason', 'mind', 'aspect', 'book', 'take', 'issue', 'way', 'woman', 'write', 'amanda', 'give', 'literally', 'save', 'jason', 'write', 'book', 'hate', 'author', 'chicken', 'give', 'character', 'grow', 'admire', 'love', 'real', 'ending', 'daniella', 'daniella', 'daniella', 'begin', 'like', 'guy', 'dream', 'girl', 'manic', 'pixie', 'dream', 'girl', 'main_character', 'get', 'marry', 'beautiful', 'far', 'land', 'artist', 'endlessly', 'compassionate', 'understanding', 'self', 'sacrifice', 'jason', 'obsessed', 'forget', 'son', 'seemingly', 'inject', 'narrative', 'plot_device', 'strong_willed', 'damsel', 'save', 'start', 'moment', 'jason', 'meet', 'party', 'jason', 'save', 'notorious', 'womanizer', 'swoop', 'snatch', 'le', 'sigh', 'jason', 'epitome', 'nice', 'guy', 'woman', 'know', 'little', 'help', 'roll_eye', 'actor', 'describe', 'exactly', 'scene', 'go', 'later', 'daniella', 'say', 'jason', 'remember', 'meet', 'save', 'guy', 'remind', 'daniella', 'author', 'insist', 'shove', 'damsel', 'distress', 'trope', 'throat', 'romantic', 'trite', 'annoying', 'stop', 'furthermore', 'understand', 'daniella', 'tell', 'guy', 'hundred', 'jasons', 'threaten', 'life', 'leave', 'world', 'give', 'hoot', 'affect', 'son', 'love', 'seriously', 'delusional', 'barely', 'question', 'final', 'decision', 'plunge', 'abyss', 'box', 'feel', 'like', 'character', 'building', 'realistic', 'find', 'wish', 'spend', 'little', 'time', 'world', 'world', 'world', 'hopping', 'start', 'feel', 'like', 'groundhog', 'day', 'author', 'intention', 'tactic', 'allow', 'development', 'world', 'jason', 'explore', 'personally', 'like', 'experience', 'thing', 'curious', 'jason', 'kill', 'jasons', 'rip', 'hole', 'space', 'time', 'continuum', 'physicist', 'feel', 'like', 'dire', 'consequence', 'maybe', 'science', 'explain', 'little', 'well', 'like', 'ending', 'ambiguous', 'happen', 'dessens', 'definitely', 'loose_end', 'leave', 'wonder', 'state', 'multiverse', 'awful', 'disease', 'go', 'spread', 'world', 'completely', 'obliterate', 'existence', 'sort', 'like', 'think', 'happen', 'exist', 'jason', 'exist', 'fine', 'sure', 'question', 'novel', 'like', 'delve', 'conclude', 'review']"

343,"Read on a recommendation and I really really don't understand the hype. Sure, the concept was cool and intriguing and there are some interesting ideas here and there, but not only is the execution flawed (pacing and characters are off) but the final twist makes no sense? Why would a school for the blind be windowless? Is that a thing in America? I know for a fact schools of that kind have windows over here. I mean... Why wouldn't they? What about the blind pupils with residual sight? Disabilities are on a spectrum, it's not all-or-nothing! What about seeing teachers, staff, parents? I mean clearly, there's light in there since Malorie can see... Why would the school rely exclusively on lamps rather than use natural light? I don't get it, I am baffled; if you needed a windowless building, why not try a mall? In short: baffled. Also, I was disappointed to realise that the blind survivors were not, as I first thought, blind people from before who were naturally immune to the creatures and would be best suited to adapt to a world where seeing is basically a death sentence, but abled (or seeing, at least) people who purposely mutilated themselves. So, OK. But then what about the people who were blind before? What happened to them? Especially considering te survivors live in a school for the blind! Also also, afterbirth is a thing. I'm not gonna say anymore about that particular ridiculousness. Anyway, it had great potential but saying it fell short would be a giant understatement. It's bad.

344,"I didn't like D for Deadbeat as much as the other books so far. The whole story for this book seemed pointless. Kinsey gets stiffed by a guy who hired her to deliver some money to a kid. She didn't start doing any work of the case while she waited for the check to clear and it turned out that the guy didn't have any money to pay her. Instead of shrugging it off and going about her business, Kinsey puts a lot of time and effort into trying to track this guy down and then he turns up dead. I understand that there needs to be some mystery involved, but this just felt forced. Anyway, once you get past the fact that the whole plot felt forced, it's the usual PI stuff that she does, running around asking questions and making enemies out of suspects. There was not actually that much happening in this book, lots of her running around with no idea who did it and no real leads as to where to start to flush out the perp. It was still entertaining to read, it just wasn't as good as the first three books in the series. There is one other thing that really bothered me about this book,I was not that impressed with Kinsey finally sleeping with Jonah. It just seemed like a bad idea since his wife came back and he jumped when she called. But in this book, all of a sudden he seems to realize that his wife is a jerk and he wants Kinsey. Kinsey doesn't try very hard to get him to realize that he is still married and sleeps with him anyway. I am betting that this turns into a problem for them in coming books. One thing that I did like about this fourth book was the ending. It was pretty shocking and a little bit sad. But the thing that I liked the most was Kinsey didn't get into a life or death situation at the end, she just tried to talk the kid out of killing himself. I was afraid that each book would end with Kinsey in some kind of life or death situation and either have to save herself or have someone else save her. This ending was just as exciting as the others where she has to get away from the bad guy without being as ridiculous as that. Other than those couple of things that bothered me about this installment, it was still an easy and entertaining read. Kinsey is still the same tough girl character that is kind of manly. I am waiting for her to soften up a little bit and maybe act a little more womanly, but I am not holding my breath.

345,"I really enjoyed this. I'd watched the first season of the T.V. show and hadn't realized it was based on a book series. I'm glad I picked up the book and gave it a try. Aside from appearances, the casting for Vic & Henry were pretty good, personality wise (I could be a sucker for Katee Sackhoff & Lou Diamond Phillips), but the show leaves a lot of the humor of the books out and feels much darker. I enjoy the Longmire of the book more, as well, given we get a little more backstory (and less rage - the ""Denver"" storyline is not at all in the first book, if at all in the series - that'll remain to be seen). This may sound like a strange comparison, but if you liked Dresden files, you might like Longmire. Obviously Longmire is no modern day Chicago wizard and this is a perfectly mundane setting in WY with a perfectly mortal, normal human beings - but the snarky one liners and dark humor (with a splash of the absurd) will appeal to Dresden (and possibly Iron Druid) fans. It gets a touch immature, but there were some great ""snort out loud"" moments. I feel it could make a good crossover book if you aren't normally a fan of mysteries, but want to give one a try. I'd plant this in the ""cozy"" category, as well. We're pretty well shielded from the gruesome, though there is definitely dark subject matter. The book has a few rough edges - one enterprising person took the liberty of correcting a typo with a ball point pen in my copy - but nothing so much that I felt turned off. 1 star down for the rough edges, but otherwise, a fun sick day read. Side comments: Hmmm... on the murderer. I like putting SOME clues together... I kinda hate it when the mystery is solved out of left field and you don't get to play a role. Then again, I hate it when I have it figured out by the first chapter, too. I loved ""George is gone again..."" Turk's car. Turks Grand-Uncle... who is *hilarious* and horrible at the same time.

346,"I do not often read short story collections. Not to say I have anything against the format; as a matter of fact, a well-crafted short story is often rather like instant gratification to a reader: it does not take the same amount of time to read as a novel, but can be just as fulfilling if it's good. But I find that, as a rule, I only enjoy short stories if they are in collections written by one author, and preferably linked to one particular world or universe. Lots of writers do this, especially those who have long-running series, as a means of filling in certain gaps in the series, or for telling stories they might like to tell, but which don't have the necessary substance for a novel. And then there are the collections that are meant to be tributes to a single author. This is usually done for authors who have had immense impact on the genre in which they wrote. After the King, for instance, is a collection of short stories containing works by some of the most notable fantasy writers still living, and is a tribute to none other than J.R.R. Tolkien himself (the ""King"" in the title of the collection). That one proved to be quite an enjoyable read - one story in particular, Peter S. Beagle's ""The Naga,"" is one of the stories I ask my students to read for class. But it is very rare that short story tributes are made up for a fictional character - mostly because said character would have to be more influential than the writer who created him or her. However, that is most assuredly the case with Sherlock Holmes. Though a fictional character, there is no doubting that Holmes has a stronger grip on the imaginations of all those who encounter him, in his various incarnations, than his own creator, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Indeed, so powerful is the presence of Sherlock Holmes in the minds of people that it's hard to think of him as fictional at all. Many people - mostly diehard Sherlockians, but oftentimes more run-of-the-mill folk as well - speak of Holmes as if he were a real person. They speak of Dr. Watson as real, of Moriarty as real, of Irene Adler as real. It is as if, through some mysterious, magical means, Sherlock Holmes and the characters around him have seemingly emerged and detached themselves from the fabric of Doyle's stories, and embedded themselves in that strange gray space between true history and speculation. So powerful is Holmes's hold on the imagination of all those who encounter him, that it seems only fitting that a tribute collection of short stories should be made up for him - not, it should be noted, for his creator. And that is what A Study in Sherlock is, essentially: a tribute collection of short stories honoring the most quintessential, most influential detective in fiction (and maybe history). The authors listed are notable, though I am only familiar with very few of them. I know who the editors are: Laurie R. King is the author of the Mary Russell series, and Leslie S. Klinger is one of the most famous Holmes scholars, not least because he put together the Sherlock Holmes Reference Library, which is an annotated version of the entire Holmes canon. I know Neil Gaiman, of course, being a fan of his work. I am also familiar with Lee Child, though I have not read his work; the Jack Reacher novels are really more my mother's thing than mine. The other authors are utter unknowns to me. None of this matters, of course. I am always happy to acquaint myself with new authors, and sometimes a short story is a handy way of doing so, especially in collections such A Study in Sherlock. However, one of the most common problems I have with these short story collections popped up almost immediately: a noticeable lack of consistency. Some of the stories were utterly intriguing. For instance, the first one in the collection, Alan Bradley's ""You'd Better Go in Disguise,"" was interesting because it told a Holmes story from an utterly different perspective: that of the criminal. The reader does not know initially that the narrator of the tale is a criminal, but this is quickly revealed in the climax and denouement. This was an utterly diverting new way of looking at the classic Holmes story. Another excellent example of the above is ""The Man With the Twisted Lips"" by S.J. Rozan, which is a direct reference to the Holmes story of the same title - no surprise there, really, since this story is actually a behind-the-scenes look at what was going on in ""The Man With the Twisted Lip."" In Rozan's story, it turns out that Holmes and Watson's involvement was carefully planned by the Chinese immigrants who maintained opium dens in the area, setting the events up as a means of ensuring the lascar of the original story is chased out of their territory for good, but without calling undue attention to themselves. The way this story parallels Doyle's story is such that it is almost impossible to read the original without thinking of Rozan's, and how it fits so neatly into its fabric. Equally good is Thomas Perry's ""The Startling Events in the Electrified City."" Narrated (as expected) by Dr. Watson, it is a story that takes place after the events at Reichenbach Falls, and follows Holmes and Watson to the United States, where they receive a most unusual request: they are asked to help in the assassination of President McKinley - by McKinley himself. While there is nothing new with Holmes being involved in the affairs of famous historical figures (particularly those who were alive when he was), this one takes a whole new spin on things by introducing an element of conspiracy into the supposedly ""known"" facts of a historical event. All of a sudden it is tempting to look at certain historical askance and wonder if it were not possible that Holmes might have had a hand in them somehow. Equally interesting is ""The Adventure of the Concert Pianist"" by Margaret Maron. Though it is set during Holmes's time, this is one of those stories that does not directly involve Holmes at all - in fact, the case is solved by Dr. Watson (thus proving that he is not the bumbling, well-meaning idiot he is portrayed as sometimes), and the narrator is none other than Mrs. Hudson herself. Though the case is one of those unremarkable things that Holmes would likely have been able to solve blindfolded and with one hand tied behind his back, it was still a wonderful opportunity for Dr. Watson to take center-stage, and to hear (for the first time, I think) Mrs. Hudson speak on her famous lodger (and perhaps her desire for him as well?). A great many more of these stories, however, do not deal with Sherlock himself - in fact the connection is rather tenuous, like in ""The Adventure of the Purloined Paget"" by Phillip Margolin and Jerry Margolin, which involves a group of very wealthy Sherlockian collectors and a newly-discovered story, supposedly written by Doyle for Queen Victoria, and illustrated by Paget, hence the title of the story. Others are rewrites of Doyle originals, such as ""The Eyak Interpreter"" Dana Stebenow, a rewrite of Doyle's ""The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter,"" but updated for an audience more familiar with the blog format. It even includes comments on blog entries, some of which have been deleted by their authors. ""The Case that Holmes Lost"" is a meta look into a Holmes story that will never see the light of day, with the focus on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself. And then there are the stories that are inspired by Holmes, instead of being about him or being a rewrite of his original advenures. ""The Last of Sheila Locke-Holmes"" by Laura Lippman and ""A Spot of Detection"" by Jacqueline Winspear are precisely that, with Lippman writing a coming-of-age story for a young girl who wants to be just like Holmes (and a great many other detectives, besides), while Winspear writes about a young boy who turns out to be a young Raymond Chandler, and how Holmes turned him into the writer he would eventually become. Some stories, though, are just totally out there. I was expecting this with Neil Gaiman, and his story ""The Case of Death and Honey"" is precisely that: it takes off from an interesting plot point in ""The Aventure of the Creeping Man,"" with Holmes advising Watson to change some information in the actual facts of the case, thus allowing Holmes to freely pursue the real ""rejuvenation extract"" mentioned in the story - not an extract from langurs, as the story claims, but the elixir of life itself. Another story in this vein is ""As To 'An Exact Knowledge of London'"" by Tony Broadbent, which plays on the idea that Holmes and Watson are reborn, over and over again, even as their greatest nemeses, Professor Moriarty and Sebastian Moran. This one is interesting if only because it contains an up-to-date list of contemporary Holmes media culture, plus an image of Watson and Holmes working on computers and surrounded by all the technological trappings of the 21st century. Such a diverse selection of writers, all writing stories in their own style and each with a different take on Holmes and the culture Holmes has created, is great for gaining insight into the ways that Doyle's creation has embedded himself into the collective consciousness of all those who have encountered him. However, I find that not all of these stories are quite so fun. Some, like Broadbent's story, really aren't about mystery at all, and are only interesting for their connection (and manipulation) of Doyle's characters. Neither did I enjoy Lippman's tale all that much, since I was rather hoping for a child-sleuth story with coming-of-age undertones, not a coming-of-age story with child-sleuth undertones. I suppose my dislike of some stories is due to the fact that I was looking for a particular type, or types, of stories, and the ones I didn't quite enjoy simply did not fall into those types. Perhaps if I were to read the stories I did not enjoy some other time, when I'm in the mood for them, I might enjoy them then. But, regardless of how I might feel about the individual stories at a later date, A Study in Sherlock comes off as rather inconsistent to me - and probably always will. I would have appreciated a certain kind of cohesion to the types of stories that were included, and not just a grab-bag of Holmes-related, Holmes-inspired material. I did not particularly enjoy the uneven nature of the collection, jumping from one type of story to the other. Overall, A Study in Sherlock is an interesting collection: a testament to the power Sherlock Holmes wields in the collective imagination. But the grab-bag nature of the collection, and general uneven feel as one moves from one story to the next, might prove to be a bit irritating to the reader who sits down to read the collection in its entirety, and not just one or two stories because it is by an author the reader recognizes. Individually, the stories are quite good, but together, they do not make for a very cohesive collection.",3,thriller,"['read', 'short_story', 'collection', 'format', 'matter', 'fact', 'craft',

348,"(Audiobook) 3.5 stars The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious  - Crouch via Einstein This is a hard book to rate. Whatever Rating I give, I am not sure if I am being too hard or too soft on it. On one hand this is a really exciting book. You will not be bored. It is easy to get into and you will definitely want to find out how it ends. The audiobook is top notch thanks to Jon Lindstrom (General Hospital!) On the other hand this book is derivative, not just of other Science Fiction but of Crouch's previous hit song ""Wayward Pines"", it has gaping plot holes and made me irrationally angry with some if it's choices. I guess I enjoyed it as something of a guilty pleasure. So the plot immediately calls to mind various Star Trek episodes, ""Sliders"" and a very big nod to ""Sliding Doors"". If it reminded you of something else, tell me what I have missed. The central premise is diabolically brilliant to the point I can't believe no one has come up with it before. I really want to know whether the main twist has been done before. The main character has his life and wife stolen by another version of himself from an alternate reality   Have you read this anywhere before? If this is new it is a pretty fantastic riff on the *many* alternate realities stories. If it isn't, then the whole thing is a bit like a band of teenagers who never bothered to listen to any old records and think the 3 chord rock they are playing is original and inspired. I reserve the right to change my opinion here! So this book starts strong, there is really no effing around in it. I did immediately notice that like in ""Wayward Pines"" we have our hero waking up in a hospital where everything is weird and trying to rationalise the weirdness by wondering (again and again) if they are on drugs or are victim of an elaborate prank and generally taking way too long to realise they are involved in some really weird shit. New wrinkle this time ""Maybe it's a brain tumour"" It's not a tumour!! I was definitely in on the mystery....then the book commits one of my Cardinal pet peeves - it puts me in a ""hard science fiction"" state of mind with its dabbling in physics and extended explanation of ""Schroedinger's Cat"" - before throwing the hard science out the window in favour of going batshit crazy. I am more then happy with ""magic"" or ""alien artefact"" to explain just about anything. If you are going to try and ground the story in reality or in the realm of scientific explanation, I need it *kept* in reality. This is admittedly a very hard thing to do - which is why I appreciate/have a love-hate relationship,with authors like Kim Stanley Robison, Stephen Baxter and Neal Stephenson. Once an author tickles the ""this is Science"" part of my brain I am on high alert for anything ridiculous. I found one of the plot devices used so, so stupid it took me about 90 minutes to recover and get back into the story. Once I did, I started to really enjoy it again. I can't pretend that I didn't care what happened, I was IN, I just had to kind of tune out the flaws. I think this book is best enjoyed as a love story with some SF elements. If you don't expect too much you won't be disappointed. The book has been made into a movie. I cannot imagine how they will take some of the hokier elements that work as a book and make them work on screen. Everyone is going to be crazy hot though for Daniella, who's major character attribute is that she likes to drink wine what I wouldn't do for a wine drinking woman! As I mentioned Jon Lindstrom is excellent. The story is told in first person and I totally believed he  was  Jason. Many narrators overdo the ""action"" portions of the story  Look how exciting this is to me!!! Lindstrom was note perfect, with a lesser narrator I may have had a *harder* time buying everything. So this was a fun ride/guilty pleasure/mixed bag of trick or treats. Ityped this on an iPad while I have had as much wine as Daniella on a night out and will edit it again at some point. LETS GO SPOILERS. (/SOBER EDIT MODE ENGAGED) While it is beyond the scope of this review to go into all the plot holes and contrivances, the main problems I had were: Just shooting Daniella in the head then expecting Jason to cooperate blew me away with its dumbness. ""The Jason I know would see the big picture"" umm go eat a bag of unsalted monkey dicks - you just killed the only person I care about. I normally can never think of alternatives but in maybe 5-10 pages we could have had Daniella abducted and used as leverage. OR we could not know what happened to her and build a relationship between Amanda and Jason in captivity that leads to her revealing that Daniella and lover boy were killed by the evil people and she can't live with it and wants to help. As it stood Amanda throwing her life away on the spot didn't make a lot of sense. I know we are supposed to hate evil Corp and Crouch wants to keep things moving but this was so ridiculous I kinda zoned out for a good 90 minutes. So we get this speech about the superposition of the molecules and ""science-science good-good"" but THEN it turns out you have to ""wish upon a star"" to enter the reality of your choice. WTF has this got to do with anything scientific? You think happy thoughts like Peter Pan and enter your never never land of choice? Be careful about any underlying emotions? It just killed the ""grounded in reality"" concepts we spent our time establishing. Once I got back on board I didn't mind the ending. I don't want to get into the ""many Jason's"" issues and quibbles and I can't imagine how dumb this will be in the movie. Can we get M Night Shamalyn again? I would have thought though that the drama and intensity of planning your own murder the way Jason2 did to abduct Jason would have been a big enough climax to end the book in a satisfying way. I was good with what we got though. Obviously Crouch had to give us ANOTHER twist in the form of the many Jason's but I would have just gone with Jason vs Jason 2. Anyway it was good, I got my money's worth I can't complain.",3,thriller,"['audiobook', 'star', 'beautiful', 'thing', 'experience', 'mysterious', 'crouch', 'einstein', 'hard', 'book', 'rate', 'rating', 'sure', 'hard', 'soft', 'hand', 'exciting', 'book', 'bored', 'easy', 'definitely', 'want', 'find', 'end', 'audiobook', 'notch', 'thank', 'jon', 'lindstrom', 'general', 'hospital', 'hand', 'book', 'derivative', 'science_fiction', 'crouch', 'previous', 'hit', 'song', 'wayward', 'pine', 'gaping', 'plot_hole', 'irrationally', 'angry', 'choice', 'guess', 'enjoy', 'guilty_pleasure', 'plot', 'immediately', 'call', 'mind', 'star', 'trek', 'episode', 'sliders', 'big', 'nod', 'sliding', 'doors', 'remind', 'tell', 'miss', 'central', 'premise', 'diabolically', 'brilliant', 'point', 'believe', 'come', 'want', 'know', 'main', 'twist', 'main_character', 'life', 'wife', 'steal', 'version', 'alternate_reality', 'read', 'new', 'pretty', 'fantastic', 'riff', 'alternate_reality', 'story', 'thing', 'bit', 'like', 'band', 'teenager', 'bother', 'listen', 'old', 'record', 'think', 'chord', 'rock', 'play', 'original', 'inspired', 'reserve', 'right', 'change', 'opinion', 'book', 'start', 'strong', 'effing', 'immediately', 'notice', 'like', 'wayward', 'pines', 'hero', 'wake', 'hospital', 'weird', 'try', 'rationalise', 'weirdness', 'wonder', 'drug', 'victim', 'elaborate', 'prank', 'generally', 'take', 'way', 'long', 'realise', 'involve', 'weird', 'shit', 'new', 'wrinkle', 'time', 'maybe', 'brain', 'tumour', 'tumour', 'definitely', 'mystery', 'book', 'commit', 'cardinal', 'pet_peeve', 'put', 'hard', 'science_fiction', 'state', 'mind', 'dabbling', 'physics', 'extended', 'explanation', 'schroedinger', 'cat', 'throw', 'hard', 'science', 'window', 'favour', 'go', 'batshit', 'crazy', 'happy', 'magic', 'alien', 'artefact', 'explain', 'go', 'try', 'ground', 'story', 'reality', 'realm', 'scientific', 'explanation', 'need', 'keep', 'reality', 'admittedly', 'hard', 'thing', 'appreciate', 'love', 'hate', 'relationship', 'author', 'like', 'kim', 'stanley', 'robison', 'stephen', 'baxter', 'neal', 'stephenson', 'author', 'tickle', 'science', 'brain', 'high', 'alert', 'ridiculous', 'find', 'plot_device', 'stupid', 'take', 'minute', 'recover', 'story', 'start', 'enjoy', 'pretend', 'care', 'happen', 'kind', 'tune', 'flaw', 'think', 'book', 'well', 'enjoy', 'love', 'story', 'sf', 'element', 'expect', 'will', 'disappoint', 'book', 'movie', 'imagine', 'hoki', 'element', 'work', 'book', 'work', 'screen', 'go', 'crazy', 'hot', 'daniella', 'major', 'character', 'attribute', 'like', 'drink', 'wine', 'wine', 'drink', 'woman', 'mention', 'jon', 'lindstrom', 'excellent', 'story', 'tell', 'person', 'totally', 'believe', 'jason', 'narrator', 'overdo', 'action', 'portion', 'story', 'look', 'exciting', 'lindstrom', 'note', 'perfect', 'less', 'narrator', 'hard', 'time', 'buy', 'fun_ride', 'guilty_pleasure', 'mix', 'bag', 'trick', 'treat', 'itype', 'ipad', 'wine', 'daniella', 'night', 'edit', 'point', 'let', 'spoiler', 'edit', 'mode', 'engage', 'scope', 'review', 'plot_hole', 'contrivance', 'main', 'problem', 'shoot', 'daniella', 'head', 'expect', 'jason', 'cooperate', 'blow_away', 'dumbness', 'jason', 'know', 'big', 'picture', 'umm', 'eat', 'bag', 'unsalted', 'monkey', 'dick', 'kill', 'person', 'care', 'normally', 'think', 'alternative', 'maybe', 'page', 'daniella', 'abduct', 'leverage', 'know', 'happen', 'build', 'relationship', 'amanda', 'jason', 'captivity', 'lead', 'reveal', 'daniella', 'lover', 'boy', 'kill', 'evil', 'people', 'live', 'want', 'help', 'stand', 'amanda', 'throw', 'life', 'away', 'spot', 'lot', 'sense', 'know', 'suppose', 'hate', 'evil', 'corp', 'crouch', 'want', 'thing', 'move', 'ridiculous', 'kinda', 'zone', 'good', 'minute', 'speech', 'superposition', 'molecule', 'science', 'science', 'good', 'good', 'turn', 'wish', 'star', 'enter', 'reality', 'choice', 'wtf', 'get', 'scientific', 'think', 'happy', 'thought', 'like', 'peter', 'pan', 'enter', 'land', 'choice', 'careful', 'underlie', 'emotion', 'kill', 'ground', 'reality', 'concept', 'spend_time', 'establish', 'get', 'board', 'mind', 'ending', 'want', 'jason', 'issue', 'quibble', 'imagine', 'dumb', 'movie', 'm', 'night', 'shamalyn', 'think', 'drama', 'intensity', 'plan', 'murder', 'way', 'abduct', 'jason', 'big', 'climax', 'end', 'book', 'satisfying', 'way', 'good', 'get', 'obviously', 'crouch', 'twist', 'form', 'jason', 'go', 'jason', 'vs', 'jason', 'good', 'get', 'money', 'worth', 'complain']"
349,"I've been in a real reading mood lately. Today I absolutely earned it. With back to back labs all day, I wanted nothing more than to sit and devour a book when I got home. I thought this one would be the perfect one because that premise is absolutely killer. I was expecting the sort of dumb dares that teenagers do for vlogs taken to the next level, with high tech and every increasing bribes and escalating danger. But, uh, what I got was more cut out characters, meh dares and a game that somehow had weird total knowledge of the characters despite also apparently having multiple games and hundreds of players going on at once. That's a little savage, and I might be a little too harsh in this review, because I had high expectations... but missed potential hurts the most. To say Vee drove me up the wall is an understatement. At first she showed a lot of promise. I really liked the idea of a softer, quieter theatre geek with a passion for fashion and make up and exploring that whole how much she does behind the scenes. I really really liked the idea that this character would then be thrust into the spotlight. That whole conflict could have been really well played out, with her trying to balance her desire to be noticed with her real personality and, you know, maybe not liking what she had to be on camera. Instead, she turned into a whiny, spineless character who had one of the least compelling reasons for continuing in the competition. Like okay full ride to fashion school, but she gave no indication before it was offered that she actually wanted that? It is a good prize, but there was no real heart wrenching 'I have to take it' sort of stakes. I mean, if she lost, all that would happen was that her parents would have to help her with uni, and it might be a little tough. But still do-able. Because of this, when things started getting harder and 'out of character' her motivation to continue really didn't strike a chord... She seemed to continue because of Ian, but not because she wanted to save him from his dad, but because she wanted a hot boy's attention. And then, later when she rebelled against everything and tried to quit the game it just came off as selfish. Easy for her to decide when she wasn't facing the desperation the other characters were... Ian was another wasted potential. He could have been a really sweet love interest, with a nice conflict between the scared boy underneath and the pretty face on camera especially given that his motivations were very real and very compelling. Wanting to get away from an abusive father meant that it was realistic that he'd put himself through anything and everything, and made him so much more likeable. How could you really like Vee when he's fighting for a ticket on a bus to go away and camping gear to set up somewhere safe, and she wants new expensive designer shoes.....  Instead, he fell kinda flat. Without the proper time to develop, and insta love making it hard to really get to know him/want to like him, he didn't have a lot to him. Their whole relationship happened in the course of like maybe three hours, and I think that's what bugged me the most. I get that this had to happen fast because snowballing and building consequences work best on a deadline... but I think it would have been interesting to see the characters getting little tastes of what they wanted. It would have made them continuing even more believable because once you see you really can get what you want... well it seems a lot more appealing than these vague promises. That little dare here and there could have given time for Ian and Vee to actually get close (and build their motivations....) and then their relationship would have been something real. Instead we get insta love and really forced cute moments between strangers . I really liked the first dares. They made sense as sort of tasters, and would be tame enough to really draw people in. And actually, I think I disagree with a lot of other low rating reviewers when I say I actually liked the personal ones. I get that they're not as epic viewing, but that sort of pushing people in their own lives, with things like attacking people that have had a crush, or hurting old exes  it would actually draw viewers in to see if they would or not. But I do agree that these dares would only work so much, and that actual visual, physical dares would be a more realistic finale. The ending was...  a mess. I'm so confused. I read the scene over a couple times and I still don't get what the point was with the guns. I don't know how it would have worked for Nerve to get them to kill each other, and the stand off dragged on to the point where it lost tension. I don't know how she could just walk out like that, and there was no real look at the consequences at what the others lost. I'm not saying she should have continued, but she condemned Ian to living with an abusive father and it was never touched on even though they're supposedly so in love... Also, one final complaint.... what on earth did the prologue have to do with it? I spent the last third of the book looking for that girl, or some mention of what happened. I honestly thought the book would go back to that moment... For all my complaints, I enjoyed the concept of this book. I liked the world it was set in, and the mystery behind Nerve. I was just let down by my high expectations, and the thoughts of what I wished they would do.",2,thriller,"['real', 'reading', 'mood', 'lately', 'today', 'absolutely', 'earn', 'lab', 'day', 'want', 'sit', 'devour', 'book', 'get', 'home', 'think', 'perfect', 'premise', 'absolutely', 'killer', 'expect', 'sort', 'dumb', 'dare', 'teenager', 'vlog', 'take', 'level', 'high', 'tech', 'increase', 'bribe', 'escalate', 'danger', 'uh', 'get', 'cut', 'character', 'meh', 'dare', 'game', 'weird', 'total', 'knowledge', 'character', 'despite', 'apparently', 'have', 'multiple', 'game', 'hundred', 'player', 'go', 'little', 'savage', 'little', 'harsh', 'review', 'high_expectation', 'miss', 'potential', 'hurt', 'vee', 'drive', 'wall', 'understatement', 'show', 'lot', 'promise', 'like', 'idea', 'soft', 'quiet', 'theatre', 'geek', 'passion', 'fashion', 'explore', 'scene', 'like', 'idea', 'character', 'thrust', 'spotlight', 'conflict', 'play', 'try', 'balance', 'desire', 'notice', 'real', 'personality', 'know', 'maybe', 'like', 'camera', 'instead', 'turn', 'whiny', 'spineless', 'character', 'compelling', 'reason', 'continue', 'competition', 'like', 'okay', 'ride', 'fashion', 'school', 'give', 'indication', 'offer', 'actually', 'want', 'good', 'prize', 'real', 'heart_wrench', 'sort', 'stake', 'mean', 'lose', 'happen', 'parent', 'help', 'uni', 'little', 'tough', 'able', 'thing', 'start', 'get', 'hard', 'character', 'motivation', 'continue', 'strike', 'chord', 'continue', 'ian', 'want', 'save', 'dad', 'want', 'hot', 'boy', 'attention', 'later', 'rebel', 'try', 'quit', 'game', 'come', 'selfish', 'easy', 'decide', 'face', 'desperation', 'character', 'ian', 'waste', 'potential', 'sweet', 'love_interest', 'nice', 'conflict', 'scared', 'boy', 'underneath', 'pretty', 'face', 'camera', 'especially', 'give', 'motivation', 'real', 'compelling', 'want', 'away', 'abusive', 'father', 'mean', 'realistic', 'likeable', 'like', 'vee', 'fight', 'ticket', 'bus', 'away', 'camping', 'gear', 'set', 'safe', 'want', 'new', 'expensive', 'designer', 'shoe', 'instead', 'fall', 'kinda', 'flat', 'proper', 'time', 'develop', 'insta_love', 'make', 'hard', 'know', 'want', 'like', 'lot', 'relationship', 'happen', 'course', 'like', 'maybe', 'hour', 'think', 'bug', 'happen', 'fast', 'snowballing', 'building', 'consequence', 'work', 'well', 'deadline', 'think', 'interesting', 'character', 'get', 'little', 'taste', 'want', 'continue', 'believable', 'want', 'lot', 'appealing', 'vague', 'promise', 'little', 'dare', 'give', 'time', 'ian', 'vee', 'actually', 'close', 'build', 'motivation', 'relationship', 'real', 'instead', 'insta_love', 'force', 'cute', 'moment', 'stranger', 'like', 'dare', 'sense', 'sort', 'taster', 'tame', 'draw', 'people', 'actually', 'think', 'disagree', 'lot', 'low', 'rating', 'reviewer', 'actually', 'like', 'personal', 'one', 'epic', 'viewing', 'sort', 'push', 'people', 'life', 'thing', 'like', 'attack', 'people', 'crush', 'hurt', 'old', 'ex', 'actually', 'draw', 'viewer', 'agree', 'dare', 'work', 'actual', 'visual', 'physical', 'dare', 'realistic', 'finale', 'ending', 'mess', 'confused', 'read', 'scene', 'couple', 'time', 'point', 'gun', 'know', 'work', 'nerve', 'kill', 'stand', 'drag', 'point', 'lose', 'tension', 'know', 'walk', 'like', 'real', 'look', 'consequence', 'lose', 'say', 'continue', 'condemn', 'ian', 'live', 'abusive', 'father', 'touch', 'supposedly', 'love', 'final', 'complaint', 'earth', 'prologue', 'spend', 'book', 'look', 'girl', 'mention', 'happen', 'honestly', 'think', 'book', 'moment', 'complaint', 'enjoy', 'concept', 'book', 'like', 'world', 'set', 'mystery', 'nerve', 'let', 'high_expectation', 'thought', 'wish']"
350,"I loved the concept. And the beginning was more than encouraging. The first scenes conveyed all the confusion, fear, and stress of a person who wakes up with no recollection of where they are, who they are, or even how old they are supposed to be. And then the book follows the standard bathtub curve. It slags, it picks up for an ""intense"" climax  and the same-old happy end. Which was not even unexpected  . But it was entertaining. And not bad at all. Most of the mediocre reviews I read on goodreads complained about the credibility of the medical condition. I admit that I didn't care about the credibility. I realize that the medical condition is broken on multiple fronts and it's plain wrong, but generally I leave a lot of creative freedom to the author. As long as they set their universe and rules clearly and follow them consistently (oops! is it too obvious I read way too much fantasy? ), I follow along. That is unless they decide to mess with computers and technology facts, in which case I get upset kind of easily. What can I say? Professional vices...  What I did care about (and I didn't like at all) was the way that the medical condition devolved and disappeared to give us the happy ending.

351,"This thriller, as advertised, was definitely a page-turner. The pace was quick and it stayed so throughout the narrative. The premise of a high-tech house that affects its occupants is interesting and unique. The structure was also unique: the story is told from the points of view of 2 women who lived in the house, one lived there ""then"" and the other lives there in the ""now"" of the book. Both narrators speak in the 1st person, present tense. This works for the ""now"" narrator, but it's a little jarring when the ""then"" narrator speaks in the present tense when we know early in the story that she's dead. She even narrates her own death. How is she able to tell her story when she's dead? She's not writing or recording it. And to whom is she speaking? I really struggled with this structure. Another aspect of the story I had trouble with was the characterizations. I think the author was trying to show that people aren't always what they seem. But in doing so, he had the 4 main characters behave in ways that seemed ""out of character."" I didn't find their behaviors to be consistently plausible. The ending contains some interesting twists, including one I really liked that gives a new interpretation of the book's title. But the ending seemed rather muddled to me. Some of the twists were marred by the ""out of character"" problem, which made the resolution less than satisfying to me.",3,thriller,"['thriller', 'advertise', 'definitely', 'page_turner', 'pace', 'quick', 'stay', 'narrative', 'premise', 'high', 'tech', 'house', 'affect', 'occupant', 'interesting', 'unique', 'structure', 'unique', 'story', 'tell', 'point_view', 'woman', 'live', 'house', 'live', 'live', 'book', 'narrator', 'speak', 'person', 'present', 'tense', 'work', 'narrator', 'little', 'jarring', 'narrator', 'speak', 'present', 'tense', 'know', 'early', 'story', 'dead', 'narrate', 'death', 'able', 'tell', 'story', 'dead', 'write', 'record', 'speak', 'struggle', 'structure', 'aspect', 'story', 'trouble', 'characterization', 'think', 'author', 'try', 'people', 'main_character', 'behave', 'way', 'character', 'find', 'behavior', 'consistently', 'plausible', 'ending', 'contain', 'interesting', 'twist', 'include', 'like', 'give', 'new', 'interpretation', 'book', 'title', 'ending', 'muddled', 'twist', 'mar', 'character', 'problem', 'resolution', 'satisfying']"

354,"I'm holding off on giving this five stars, even though it felt, to me as a lifelong Stephen King fan, a five star read. Meanwhile back in reality, it's probably more of a three and a half star actual novel. It's the sequel to The Shining, and it's about grown up Dan Torrance who's back in New England, and meets a little girl who has similar powers (and even moreso) and she is being targeted by a bunch of crazy supernatural beings who travel around in RVs. The crazy supernatural people in the RVs, the True Knot, are awesome, and a prime example of what SK is best at, asking you ""hey, wouldn't it be cool if there were a bunch of supernatural people traveling around in RVs?"" and then goes on to sketch out a great scenario for them. Probably the best thing about this book for me was that I completely believed that grown up Dan Torrance was really and truly little Danny from The Shining. The parts I enjoyed the most are very plot dependent, so I'm putting them in spoilers. Ok, jumping to the end, EVERYONE IMPORTANT CAME OUT ALIVE, which feels like an amazing gift from Stephen King. I don't know, maybe in a first novel from an unknown writer I would be more critical of this ... but we are talking AN ENTIRE READING LIFE of being brutally traumatized by SK characters dying in ways that broke my heart. I was even trying to suss it out ... okay, it's possible Dan won't make it out alive (he does! ), and then I was figuring Billy would be the one to go, because he's a nice old guy, and his whole character seems to be set up as the sacrificial lamb, BUT HE MAKES IT! Maybe this isn't realistic, but I remember having to stop reading IT for like three hours while I sobbed like a crazy person over (okay, I said spoilers but I guess I shouldn't spoil IT so I'll redact the character's name ...) and trust me, having the crew survive this novel is something that I feel was owed to me personally. And I'm the kind of Stephen King fan who gets choked up over Dark Tower references, and there were just a few. And I loved being initially suspicious of the Tiny Town train, because I'm well-versed in Choo Choo Charlie ... and now we have a good train! Sweet! Oh, and although I already mentioned it, I LOVED the True Knot. They're horrible, you want Dan and team to win ... but there were moments that knocked me out.

356,"Holy Crap, Dark Matter was amazing. Not without flaws, but by the nature of its premise I think it required flaws to work. Even so, it was nearly impossible to put down. First to the main character. We meet Jason Dessen. From tight first person perspective. He feels real. He has that rare organic feeling as written that he's a real person. I became very invested in this character, making this a compelling sci-fi thriller. I was on the edge of my seat...would he survive or not and at what cost? The voice, the voice of the character felt quite authentic. Admittedly, he fluctuates sometimes between being more human (at times less likable) and a bit idealized but despite that, it was a real human voice talking in my head. And that is what made the thriller so thrilling. The plot was hot. Never slowed down. Unexpected turns and twists, without a doubt, and with one major exception they all felt natural. The minor flaw: Jason idealized his family when it actually sounded like his marriage was extremely mundane and had lost its luster. And he never really confronts that reality even though his wife does, and the author brings it up. It's a dead end issue that the character does not confront emotionally, and I think the book would have been improved if at some point he had acknowledged and considered this issue. The major flaw (a spoiler): Jason does NOT seem like a murderer, yet he and all his quantum doubles rather quickly turn to murdering each other to eliminate the competition for his wife, some even putting his wife and son in the crossfire. There are many aspects to consider around this revelation. First, I think the author needed to do it to really pump up the drama of the last quarter of the book. Second, why would he believe his wife would accept someone who was actively looking to kill another man even if that man is ""him?"" Or even worse because it's him? Crouch has her look the other way, as if they aren't all equally insane going to buy weapons to kill each other. She could have chosen, NONE OF THE ABOVE because they were all crazy. They all seemed completely insane to be going on such a killing spree. No matter how wronged you are, killing a living human is a huge leap to make and the fact that Dessen went open season on ""himself"" to gain exclusive rights over his wife was creepily patriarchal in a disturbing way. It wasn't that I thought it unbelievable that a man might be driven in rage to kill. But the fact that all the Dessen's were, even the central Dessen figure...turned into madmen is not fully confronted. There was a moment where he told his wife that he had gone to the sporting goods store to buy a handgun and that was where he learned all the other quantum doubles were running around also trying to buy guns...and she never comments on it, Crouch just glides over this issue. Third, the logistics of murdering a bunch of people, even if they are all the same person...it's gonna leave bodies all over Chicago that are going to destroy his life with his family anyway. It's all a messy paradox, of course, but...frankly I had expected the central Dessen to confront the old Dessen directly in front of his wife and attempt to get her back through essentially dramatically stating his case and explaining what happened. I found the twist to attempt to kill each other...while not unbelievable, it to me turned him into a madman who didn't really deserve his wife back. And that is a flaw that bothered me. The science of this thriller is fascinating. I love cutting edge physics, such as that found in Our Mathematical Universe, which I reviewed here. One fantastical leap aside (and a farfetched one too), the core premise of this novel is on-the-money theoretical (hypothetical more accurately) quantum physics. Not only is it incredible smart in the way it's brought to life, but it's integral to the story itself without being mechanical as it was in Seveneves. Crouch confronts the core conundrum of Quantum Mechanics head on in a way that is comprehensible to the layperson.

It's a quiet look at one girl's summer after high school, when a girl gets murdered. It looks at how people in small towns deal with death and murder and insiders vs. outsiders. Parts were confusing, and I always felt like I had missed something. Now, sure, part of that might have been because I was reading it between episodes of an anime during the opening and closing songs, but even when I was focused solely on the book for a long time, I still felt like there were details that were missing. Like why she hated her boyfriend's friend so much or  why she was so sure he had something to do with the death of the girl. Really, the most interesting parts were Amelia's chapters. It was horrible reading those, seeing how full of life she was and knowing that she was about to die. I wanted more from her, why she was with her boyfriend, what happened in her classes, how exactly she decided to pursue acting and what the reactions were from everyone else in her life.

358,"<> I would have given this two more stars, had it not been a bit of a let down at the end. The atmosphere was built up quite nicely, albeit punctuated by a romance plot between the two primary characters - which I feel, was a bit of a distraction to the overall horror. The romance, somehow, did not gel with the theme - it was a little forced and contrived, brought in, as it were, as a literary lacunae where the reader can breathe a little from the horror of Heptonclough. To put it simply, it damn well diluted the horror. This is not to say that Ms. Bolton does not provide some creepy moments with her descriptions - some are good enough to linger in your mind. But the overall denouement was a big letdown - well, extremely cliched, to put it accurately. The complete lack of supernatural elements at the end was reminiscent of something out of Anne Radcliffe or Jane Austen, where every horror is a red herring; although the setting had amply built up to a pastoral horror that could have been made all the more unnerving. The theme, overall, reminded me of the folk horror tropes of British horror, like Witch Finder General or The Children of the Corn with its agoraphobic horror of open spaces and the piquant thrill of what might lurk in open view. The final revelation was nothing new - the skeletons are thrown out from everyone's closet in a hackneyed and tiresome way - something that was done with aplomb in Dolores Claiborne or Chinatown (if you catch my drift). But here they fizzle out like a bad drama series on a Saturday night. It will be some time before I decide to read another Bolton novel - if at all. My final verdict - yes, read it.

Yes, I know, she's cool either way - this series should really be about Robin, with Strike as a sidekick - but I like seeing the growth she's had since the first book, seeing her develop her detective abilities and her kick-ass (!) persona. On the other hand... I really disliked the emphasis on Robin's relationship problems and the will-they-won't-they story with Strike. I don't like the idea of the two of them together, I much prefer them to just be partners, in a work kind of way. Also, the rape backstory?

It is an interesting story that spans most of the life of one man. It delves into some deeper themes and was interesting enough to keep me reading but I just kept waiting for the creepiness which was so long in coming that much of the book felt like a slog. Standard case of expectations getting in the way of reading. The ending was pretty horrifying, maybe even too much. As a person who has lost two of the most important and beloved people in my life, the idea that they are in another place but that that place is constant pain and never-ending drudgery enslaved to intelligent ants was borderline traumatic.

362,"3.5 Stars Ally Carter is a beautiful weirdo. ""Who are you? Am I going to regret not breaking your hand? Because it's not too late. I can still totally break your hand."" Embassy Row. What a great idea. The girl shrugs. ""I'm Rosie. Germany. Twelve."" The way she says it, I know these are the facts that matter here, the embassy-kid equivalent of name, rank, and serial number. ""Grace. United States. Sixteen,"" I tell her. She nods as if we've bonded. A perfectly possible dystopian in the real world. I love it. ""We do not go past the fence. I mean, we could. But we don't. Because none of us are superexcited about starting World War Three. So we do not go past the fence."" He stares at me, as if waiting for a protest that never comes. ""Say it with me, Grace. We do not go past the fence."" ""Noah."" ""Say it."" ""We do not go past the fence,"" I tell him. ""Because we do not want to start World War Three."" ""We do not want to start World War Three,"" I add. ""Good girl."" Embassies all lined up in a row so that the German soil can be next to Canadian soil and the world is suddenly so much smaller. We were not friends. We were simply what becomes of kids who are thrust together so often that, eventually, they run out of reasons not to go play. Ally Carter is good at describing the cliche community in the most eloquent of ways. ""New blood, Grace,"" Noah explains, his voice soft beneath the ever-stronger pulse of the music. ""The sharks can smell it. Now come on. It's time for the real tour."" She still does fall into plenty of other eye-rolling cliches though. A ball? Really? Do we have to do this? Grace Grace is both adroitly capable and accident prone - an interesting combination. She's scrappy and feisty. I'd rather live in a war zone with my father than with people who call me sweetie. She likes to take risks without thinking about the consequences. She's definitely a tomboy troublemaker. ""That's okay,"" I tell her. ""I don't have a home there either."" For a second, she looks at me like I'm the saddest little orphan in the world, so I point at myself and say, ""Army brat,"" as if living on ten bases in fifteen years has left me impervious to change. Ally Carter has a way with words. His English is as good as mine, but he likes to play this game. They all do. I don't play any game that I can't win. As the book goes on I became less and less impressed with Gracie. I'm a little on the fence with the mystery. It's nothing brilliant and a little disappointing because I know how clever Ally Carter is. The execution could have also been miles better. It possessed the characterisation but not the punch. Romance He nods out the window toward the Russian embassy. Because that's the thing about Embassy Row. The boy next door is probably Russian. The romance is barely there but it's lovely. I really liked it. It's been a while since I've read a will-they-won't-they and I really enjoyed how sweet and yet deep it is. ""Whatever you say, Gracie."" ""Don't call me Gracie."" ""Okay."" Alexei slowly nods. ""It's okay.

363,"After being exposed to Sherlock Holmes through many of the adaptations, I finally read about the original. Sherlock Holmes is indeed insufferable, but I found Doyle's conception of the character far less unpleasant than, say, Cumberbatch's incarnation in the BBC series. While Sherlock is an obnoxious know-it-all, he also possesses powers of emotional observation that prevent him from being, in short, a prick (or at least an oblivious one). Doyle's prose is enjoyable and pushes the story forward without digressing into much flowery language, although Watson's reaction to Enoch Drebber's corpse borders of the absurdly melodramatic. Holmes' powers of observation and deduction (both are crucial, of course!) are on full display from his start; this is hardly an origin story in the standard sense. Listening to his summaries after his examinations is always a fast-paced journey through perfectly logical -- if sometimes necessarily speculative -- reasoning, but the inherent limitation of Doyle's mysteries is also apparent here: the reader does not have access to all of the clues. Thus, whether the book counts as a true mystery (in the Agatha Christie sense) is debatable, because the focus is not so much on the solution to the caper as on Holmes' ability to observe that which no one else -- including the reader -- is able to see. Perhaps the oddest feature of the book is the abrupt transition from Britain to America (and the Mormons), which occurred with no warning whatsoever, with the result that my friend and I thought that there was a problem with the audiobook. Over time, I actually grew to like this section, even if it could hardly be called historically or culturally accurate. Still, it was actually a pleasant episode that did eventually tie into the main story. The other issue I had with the novel was the extended narration by the culprit once caught . I hardly ever mind a good embedded narrative, but if the author sees no better way to relay crucial information without devoting ~10% of the novel to a character just describing his history, something related to the narrative probably went wrong somewhere along the way. In other words, the structure of the solution was a series of speculations by Holmes without interviewing anyone followed by a very, very long speech about what happened by a single individual. Later mystery authors justifiably took a different approach, weaving in that background information throughout the various interviews conducted throughout their novels. The story does not drag on, and was quite enjoyable throughout. The novel was even more enjoyable because I listened to it while driving through Yosemite National Park, which was not so far from some of the action in the book. I would rather give 3.5 stars, but I had to pick.",3,thriller,"['expose', 'sherlock_holmes', 'adaptation', 'finally', 'read', 'original', 'sherlock_holmes', 'insufferable', 'find', 'doyle', 'conception', 'character', 'far', 'unpleasant', 'cumberbatch', 'incarnation', 'bbc', 'series', 'sherlock', 'obnoxious', 'know', 'possess', 'power', 'emotional', 'observation', 'prevent', 'short', 'prick', 'oblivious', 'doyle', 'prose', 'enjoyable', 'push', 'story', 'forward', 'digress', 'flowery', 'language', 'watson', 'reaction', 'enoch', 'drebber', 'corpse', 'border', 'absurdly', 'melodramatic', 'holmes', 'power', 'observation', 'deduction', 'crucial', 'course', 'display', 'start', 'hardly', 'origin', 'story', 'standard', 'sense', 'listen', 'summary', 'examination', 'fast_pace', 'journey', 'perfectly', 'logical', 'necessarily', 'speculative', 'reasoning', 'inherent', 'limitation', 'doyle', 'mystery', 'apparent', 'reader', 'access', 'clue', 'book', 'count', 'true', 'mystery', 'agatha', 'christie', 'sense', 'debatable', 'focus', 'solution', 'caper', 'holmes', 'ability', 'observe', 'include', 'reader', 'able', 'odd', 'feature', 'book', 'abrupt', 'transition', 'britain', 'america', 'mormons', 'occur', 'warning', 'whatsoever', 'result', 'friend', 'think', 'problem', 'audiobook', 'time', 'actually', 'grow', 'like', 'section', 'hardly', 'call', 'historically', 'culturally', 'accurate', 'actually', 'pleasant', 'episode', 'eventually', 'tie', 'main', 'story', 'issue', 'novel', 'extended', 'narration', 'culprit', 'catch', 'hardly', 'mind', 'good', 'embed', 'narrative', 'author', 'see', 'well', 'way', 'relay', 'crucial', 'information', 'devote', 'novel', 'character', 'describe', 'history', 'relate', 'narrative', 'probably', 'go', 'wrong', 'way', 'word', 'structure', 'solution', 'series', 'speculation', 'holmes', 'interview', 'follow', 'long', 'speech', 'happen', 'single', 'individual', 'later', 'mystery', 'author', 'justifiably', 'take', 'different', 'approach', 'weave', 'background', 'information', 'interview', 'conduct', 'novel', 'story', 'drag', 'enjoyable', 'novel', 'enjoyable', 'listen', 'drive', 'yosemite', 'national', 'park', 'far', 'action', 'book', 'star', 'pick']"
364,"I have such mixed feelings about this book. Hidden Bodies is the sequel to You, which was an enthralling tale of a sociopath stalking a girl, while trying to get her to fall in love with him. If you haven't read You, go pick it up right this second. It's truly a great book, and you wouldn't enjoy this one as much without having read its predecessor first. I was very excited when I heard Hidden Bodies was coming out, but a little nervous, as well. You didn't really need a sequel. I wasn't sure how well a second book would compare to the first. Hidden Bodies did hold up well. I enjoyed it. The book made up for a few of the nitpicky issues I had with the first one. But at the same time, it kind of lost the magic and creepiness factor of You. So, this is a hard review to write. It was good, but not great. I liked the plot of Hidden Bodies. Essentially, after the mess with Beck, Joe falls for Amy (who makes a brief appearance at the end of You). Only, Amy doesn't love Joe. In fact, she's scamming him. She steals his rare books and goes off to California, in hopes of an acting career. Joe can't just let this slide, so he follows her with the intent of tracking Amy down and killing her. Along the way, he struggles with paranoia over getting caught (remember that mug he left at the murder scene in book one?) and meets a new love interest. I loved Joe's commentary on Los Angeles. It was hilarious, but still rang true about some aspiring talents. One of the things I didn't like about You was, despite the fact that it was edgy and written in an amazing tone, it did follow a predictable plot line-- bad guy likes a girl, stalks her, gets her to like him, she finds out he's crazy, etc. The surprises were all about the inner character of Joe, but there weren't any big plot twists. Hidden Bodies is very different. I had no idea what was going to happen next. The plot did kind of meander around in places, but I liked that. I didn't predict any of the twists. The writing itself was great. Kepnes does a fantastic job of getting into the mind of a sociopath. Joe's character is so complex-- he has no problems murdering people who he deems deserving, but still has a moral compass. He is pretentious and cruel, but still relatable and funny. The author makes it easy for readers to root for a serial killer. It's crazy. At the same time though, there were flaws. Joe is all about repetition. He repeats his thoughts quite often-- to convince the reader or maybe himself that he is right. Or sometimes to cover up something. But it did get a little tiresome this time around. I understand why it was there, but I wish it was toned down by maybe 25%. I also missed the second person narration. Kepnes pulled it off flawlessly in You. I see why she dropped it, because the character it was directed at wasn't around in Hidden Bodies. But the first book was so creepy partly because of the second person narration. I thought she could have written this one directed at Love (the new love interest) brilliantly. I think one of my biggest complaints about this book was just that it wasn't as creepy. It was still dark, but it was missing that spine tingling sensation that the first one gave me. There was murder, but the murders were committed more out of necessity (or what Joe thought was necessity, at least) than out of hatred. Joe feels emotions so intensely. In You, he was murdering people because he wanted to. This time around, it was because he felt that he needed to, to avoid being caught. Reading it was kinda like, ""Oh... here's another person that needs to be killed. Okay, let's get that out of the way, so we can get on with the plot."" It wasn't bad. It was just different (and less scary). I also wasn't a big fan of the side characters in this novel. In You, I didn't like Beck, but I liked Ethan and I was intrigued by Mr. Moody. All of the minor characters in this book were either unappealing or boring. Everyone Joe interacted with, from the guy he worked for to Love's brother to Milo, were all douchebag wannabe celebrities. Love was alright, but I never got enough of a grasp on her character to feel connected to her. She was better than Beck and Amy, but she still came off as a spoiled rich girl. Finally, the ending of this novel irritated me a bit. There were a few things that weren't very believable. I didn't think Love would have stayed with Joe after he confessed everything to her. And they were both a little too happy and excited about the baby . There was also a bit of a redemption arc in the last third of the book, with Joe, that I wasn't fond of. Kepnes made a point of showing some cracks in his idea of becoming a better person (such as him warning a character that the last person who was mean to him wound up dead), but I still thought it was an odd 180 degree turn from Joe. The ending wasn't bad... just a little weird. It's very open for a third novel, so I hope the author takes that opportunity to write a good conclusion to Joe's story. Personally, I wanna see him fall back into his dark, murderous mindset. It would be cool to see him face a true antagonist, such as a really intelligent bad guy, who could give Joe a run for his money. Right now, most of Joe's struggles stem from his love life or people who could turn him in. Despite my complaints, I still did like this book. I enjoyed reading the entire thing. These books are a little longer than they need to be, but I love every second of them. Joe's mind is so fascinating to me. I think that most of my issues with the book were things that Kepnes intentionally added in, rather than a careless mistake on her part. My tastes just contrasted with hers. That being said, many readers might have completely different opinions than me and love this novel. It just depends on your own tastes. I definitely would recommend it to anyone that enjoyed You. It's an interesting sequel. It just disappointed me a bit in some areas, so I couldn't bring myself to rate it higher. Kepnes's books always have great quotes, so I'm going to put some of my favorites below. 3.5/5 stars. ""I gave her as much as I had, but it's like the difference between a movie and a book: A book lets you choose how much of the blood you want to see. A book gives you the permission to see the story you want, as your mind directs. You interpret. Your Alexander Portnoy doesn't look like mine because we all have our own unique view. When you finish a movie you leave the theater with your friend and talk about the movie right away. When you finish a book you think."" ""My heart beats faster and faster, and I wish I could carry it around in a rolling suitcase. It's annoying, the way it's connected to my other bodily functions, the way my little motherfucker pores allow sweat to weep upon my forehead, the way my asshole pupils shrink and expand and I can't control them. I'm not a fucking sociopath."" ""The real horror of my life is not that I've killed some terrible people.

365,"This book is a rush. Fast paced and intense. I was kept reading quickly and guessing up to the end. I was right there along with Winter trying to figure everything out. This girl has gone through a lot and because of that finds it easier to participate and record extreme sports and other dangerous activities than get close to people. It was both painful and rewarding to watch her begin to open up and face her past in this book. Especially as that happens when she discovers her beloved sister Rose had been murdered. Rose has always been the rock in Winter's life, a constant presence through everything. Winter is devastated when she discovers that she's been killed, and determined to do everything she can to find out what happened. Gideon is Rose's ex boyfriend as well as Winter's boss and owner of the company that produces ViSEs. When I started this, I was worried he was going to turn into a love interest, and I was very happy that doesn't happen at all. Gideon is like an older brother to Winter, and very protective of her. We find out a lot more about Gideon through this book too. He definitely surprised me in places, but he is one of my favorite characters. Jesse is Winter's ViSE partner. They work together recording extreme activities like bungee jumping and shark diving. I like Jesse a lot. It's clear he cares about Winter, and I liked that when the book begins they already know each other. The romance isn't by any means the focus of the story, though it is an important element. Jesse and Winter spend a lot of time together, and I really enjoyed seeing them begin to open up more to each other. They are both a little damaged and make some mistakes with each other, but I really appreciated the rawness in their relationship. I didn't expect how heavy this book would be when I started it - in terms of what Winter goes through and the things she faces about her past and herself. There were some elements of this story that were hard for me, and I'm still not sure what I think about them. The revelations at the ending were also tough.

366,"This is a first class read. Absolutely top grade. Since I judge a novel by: 1. Entertainment value, 2. Writing excellence, 3. Literary coherence, I'd vote for this book being the best of 2012, in my opinion. Having listened to it instead of reading it meant I couldn't skip ahead, so I ended up listening to it almost for two days without pause. Plus, as the chapters ping-ponged between Amy and Nick Dunne's first person narration, with two smooth-voiced, engaging and beautifully expressive voice actors (Julia Whelan and Kirby Heyborne ), my enjoyment was INTENSE. This is the first book I've ever read where almost everyone, including characters I liked, is unlikeable for varying reasons, yet the tension, suspense and caring about what happens next never let's up. One of the main reasons is everything you think you understand about Nick and Amy is quickly turned 90 degrees around in the next chapter, and then the next, and then the next, yet it is done so skillfully that loss of respect for the characters is tempered by their humanity, or because of their fantastic raw audacity and originality. Rhonda Boney, police detective, is one of two 'good' persons in the book, but she is simply a secondary character although I admired her the most for her decency. Nick Dunne's sister, Margo, is also nice, and a welcome relief for the reader as much as she is for Nick, providing succor and balance at moments that would be too full of misery and confusion, otherwise. Remarkably, every character is absolutely necessary for atmosphere, further information, or plot twist. I did not notice the slightest wrong note or lack of emotional believability in a single word - until after I was almost finished with the book. However, there is absolutely no way to review this book without spoilers. Not a single way! Nail-biting tension is maintained at the highest level! Do yourself a favor and don't start this book until you have the time to read it straight through! The plot twists SCORCH the brain with deep, concrete-breaking stops like tight brakes on a speeding car trying to make a sudden and definitely unexpected turn of the road. But like any car race, you must go on! I'm not a doctor or a detective, but it seems to me that if the police did an autopsy on Desi, who would certainly require one because of his murder, wouldn't they have found the presence of sleeping pills in his blood? That would have exposed Amy's lies. And it seems to me the frozen vomit would certainly have been degraded over time. After all, it was full of stomach acid, as well as being frozen. Its age, if not its condition and having been saved by Amy while continuing to live with Nick despite her having comparatively rich parents would have invited questions. Why would Amy keep such valuable evidence in the same house she shared with Nick in the freezer/refrigerator in the kitchen? And I never could understand why when she ordered several hundred thousands of dollars of stuff to harass Nick with debt that everyone also thought it was proof of Nick having murdered Amy. To me, it wasn't proof of that at all. Amy was the spoiled spendthrift, not Nick. Even if it looked like Nick had decided to buy all of that stuff, why on earth would he then hide it in that shed, and create a financial condition of bankruptcy and ruin? He would have lost his half-interest in the bar, the house, his sister's financial status would have been ruined, and she was the only person he loved. Besides, buying stuff like golf clubs is not the same as buying bomb-making supplies. How was this an indicator of planning Amy's murder, if he had bought it during the year before her disappearance while he was already financially shaky? The life insurance coverage revision did not ensure Nick's future, with his bar, his sister and his father, and of course, certainly not with that kind of credit card debt! Amy is a really fun psychopath Valley Girl character. Vengeance drove her to destroy anyone who she felt either embarrassed, annoyed or bested her to the exclusion of everything else in a very believable brain-damaged way - with the exception of her proposed suicide after she saw Nick's execution. That certainly indicated the depth of her rage, but did not fit her long-range planning, list-making, selfish intelligence. Amy seemed remarkably a small picture thinker to me, focused on how the world should obey and fulfil her, even if her brilliance was like a laser beam. In addition, Nick really surprised me at the end. Being that he was apparently forged into a new person that was allowing his formerly deadened, passive internal self to come alive by the danger of being with a psychopath didn't ring true - Nick appeared deadened because of depression and failure, not because of boredom and malaise. Since it seemed misery was the cause of his passivity, it didn't feel right that Amy proving herself to be a pregnant murderer would be the thing to attract him and make him feel empowered with the challenge. Despite the utter nihilistic, over-the-top solutions that the main protagonists decided on, I felt all of the other characters were spot on in that their personalities led them to their natural, normal conclusions and actions because of who they were. Since Gillian Flynn obviously can suss out expected personality reactions, I can only conclude that the wild way Amy and Nick responded to each other was intentionally world-destroying cataclysmic. This book requires some suspension of logic on several levels. It reverberates black humor, I think, but if so, the deadly seriousness on top is a cover for the author satirically mocking marriage, love, desire, and most of all, crazed American celebrity culture, with bulls-eye accuracy. 'Amazing Amy' could be any current reality star from the Jersey Shore to Dallas, Texas to Orange County, California. Wake-up call, or is Flynn having fun? Whatever. I certainly had fun with Nick and Amy!",4,thriller,"['class', 'read', 'absolutely', 'grade', 'judge', 'novel', 'entertainment', 'value', 'writing', 'excellence', 'literary', 'coherence', 'vote', 'book', 'good', 'opinion', 'having', 'listen', 'instead', 'read', 'mean', 'skip_ahead', 'end', 'listen', 'day', 'pause', 'plus', 'chapter', 'pe', 'ponge', 'amy', 'nick', 'dunne', 'person_narration', 'smooth', 'voiced', 'engaging', 'beautifully', 'expressive', 'voice', 'actor', 'julia', 'whelan', 'kirby', 'heyborne', 'enjoyment', 'intense', 'book', 'read', 'include', 'character', 'like', 'unlikeable', 'varying', 'reason', 'tension', 'suspense', 'caring', 'happen', 'let', 'main', 'reason', 'think', 'understand', 'nick', 'amy', 'quickly', 'turn', 'degree', 'chapter', 'skillfully', 'loss', 'respect', 'character', 'temper', 'humanity', 'fantastic', 'raw', 'audacity', 'originality', 'rhonda', 'boney', 'police', 'detective', 'good', 'person', 'book', 'simply', 'secondary_character', 'admire', 'decency', 'nick', 'dunne', 'sister', 'margo', 'nice', 'welcome', 'relief', 'reader', 'nick', 'provide', 'succor', 'balance', 'moment', 'misery', 'confusion', 'remarkably', 'character', 'absolutely', 'necessary', 'atmosphere', 'information', 'plot_twist', 'notice', 'slight', 'wrong', 'note', 'lack_emotional', 'believability', 'single', 'word', 'finish', 'book', 'absolutely', 'way', 'review', 'book', 'spoiler', 'single', 'way', 'nail', 'bite', 'tension', 'maintain', 'high', 'level', 'favor', 'start', 'book', 'time', 'read', 'straight', 'plot_twist', 'scorch', 'brain', 'deep', 'concrete', 'break', 'stop', 'like', 'tight', 'brake', 'speed', 'car', 'try', 'sudden', 'definitely', 'unexpected_turn', 'road', 'like', 'car', 'race', 'doctor', 'detective', 'police', 'autopsy', 'desi', 'certainly', 'require', 'murder', 'find', 'presence', 'sleep', 'pill', 'blood', 'expose', 'amy', 'lie', 'frozen', 'vomit', 'certainly', 'degrade', 'time', 'stomach', 'acid', 'frozen', 'age', 'condition', 'having', 'save', 'amy', 'continue', 'live', 'nick', 'despite', 'have', 'comparatively', 'rich', 'parent', 'invite', 'question', 'amy', 'valuable', 'evidence', 'house', 'share', 'nick', 'freezer', 'refrigerator', 'kitchen', 'understand', 'order', 'thousand', 'dollar', 'stuff', 'harass', 'nick', 'debt', 'think', 'proof', 'nick', 'having', 'murder', 'amy', 'proof', 'amy', 'spoiled', 'spendthrift', 'nick', 'look', 'like', 'nick', 'decide', 'buy', 'stuff', 'earth', 'hide', 'shed', 'create', 'financial', 'condition', 'bankruptcy', 'ruin', 'lose', 'half', 'interest', 'bar', 'house', 'sister', 'financial', 'status', 'ruin', 'person', 'love', 'buy', 'stuff', 'like', 'golf', 'club', 'buy', 'bomb', 'make', 'supply', 'indicator', 'plan', 'amy', 'murder', 'buy', 'year', 'disappearance', 'financially', 'shaky', 'life', 'insurance', 'coverage', 'revision', 'ensure', 'nick', 'future', 'bar', 'sister', 'father', 'course', 'certainly', 'kind', 'credit', 'card', 'debt', 'amy', 'fun', 'psychopath', 'valley', 'girl', 'character', 'vengeance', 'drive', 'destroy', 'feel', 'embarrassed', 'annoy', 'best', 'exclusion', 'believable', 'brain', 'damage', 'way', 'exception', 'propose', 'suicide', 'see', 'nick', 'execution', 'certainly', 'indicate', 'depth', 'rage', 'fit', 'long', 'range', 'planning', 'list', 'making', 'selfish', 'intelligence', 'amy', 'remarkably', 'small', 'picture', 'thinker', 'focus', 'world', 'obey', 'fulfil', 'brilliance', 'like', 'laser', 'beam', 'addition', 'nick', 'surprise', 'end', 'apparently', 'forge', 'new', 'person', 'allow', 'deaden', 'passive', 'internal', 'self', 'come', 'alive', 'danger', 'psychopath', 'ring_true', 'nick', 'appear', 'deaden', 'depression', 'failure', 'boredom', 'malaise', 'misery', 'cause', 'passivity', 'feel', 'right', 'amy', 'prove', 'pregnant', 'murderer', 'thing', 'attract', 'feel', 'empowered', 'challenge', 'despite', 'utter', 'nihilistic', 'solution', 'main', 'protagonist', 'decide', 'feel', 'character', 'spot', 'personality', 'lead', 'natural', 'normal', 'conclusion', 'action', 'gillian', 'flynn', 'obviously', 'suss', 'expect', 'personality', 'reaction', 'conclude', 'wild', 'way', 'amy', 'nick', 'respond', 'intentionally', 'world', 'destroy', 'cataclysmic', 'book', 'require', 'suspension', 'logic', 'level', 'reverberate', 'black', 'humor', 'think', 'deadly', 'seriousness', 'cover', 'author', 'satirically', 'mock', 'marriage', 'love', 'desire', 'crazed', 'american', 'celebrity', 'culture', 'bull', 'eye', 'accuracy', 'amazing', 'amy', 'current', 'reality', 'star', 'jersey', 'shore', 'dallas', 'texas', 'orange', 'county', 'california', 'wake', 'flynn', 'have', 'fun', 'certainly', 'fun', 'nick', 'amy']"
367,"I actually enjoyed this book quite a lot. The first 350 pages are great, with interesting character development and engaging moral dilemmas. Moriarty's writing just pulls you along, and I never wanted to put the book down. Then the ending. Why did they have to take Polly's arm? I'm not saying Cecilia made the right decision-- I'm not sure there even is a right decision-- but what she did definitely isn't horrible enough to warrant that kind of punishment for her daughter. Plus, I don't want to read about amputation on children. I don't care what it means in a literary sense. I read this book for fun, and that wasn't fun. And the epilogue? Way to rub salt in the wound. So Polly would have been a pro tennis player? Great. Except that maybe not because a thousand other things could have stopped that from happening, but throwing it in the epilogue like that encourages the reader to blame Cecilia for it. And the heart disease? That was a cool concept. Maybe she should have put it in the actual book. If you haven't already read Big Little Lies, go do that instead.

368,"I picked up Truth or Dare hoping that it would read like a teen thriller movie. After a party with an intense game of truth or dare, three girls get menacing notes continuing the game long after its closure. Only after I got the book home and started reading it, did I realize that it was actually just a cheap rip off of Pretty Little Liars. I'll admit that I do like the PLL books, but I read them purely as a guilty pleasure-- I know they're bad, but I read them to get a trashy escape from my own life. Pretty Little Liars already fills up my need for bad YA books, though. I don't really wanna read a copycat of it. I was hoping that even if Truth or Dare borrowed the same premise, it would be a better written novel, with higher stakes, and a unique twist on that concept. Unfortunately, I was let down. The book dragged on for far too long, and by the end, I was skimming through sections just to finish it. The book wasn't necessarily terrible, it was just boring. And it brought absolutely nothing new to the table. The game of truth or dare hinted at in the summary is really minor and only lasts about 50 pages. Nothing exciting even comes of it. The dares afterwards, sent by an anonymous darer, are lackluster at best. They're pretty much the same sort of blackmail that you see in PLL. The dares do get more dangerous as the story progresses, but that's just it-- it drags on far too long. By the time things started getting more serious, I was already 200 pages in and ready for the book to be over. The secrets that the girls are protecting also seem to be too silly to warrant performing these life-risking tasks. I suppose high schoolers do live their lives by obsessing over minute drama, but I feel as if they should at least be smart enough to realize that the drama isn't important enough to risk hurting someone else over. The characters were alright, but nothing special. I could literally pair each one with their Pretty Little Liars counterpart. You have Tenley, the rich popular girl (Hanna in Shepard's books), Caitlin, the future Harvard student (Spencer), and Sydney, the artsy loner (Aria). They were all huge stereotypes. I feel as if Sydney was written to garner sympathy from readers, but I thought she was just annoying. She was supposed to be this outcast, who is above all of the high school drama. But her stereotype was too in your face for me to like her. Within the first chapter or so, she rants about how stupid pop music is and how petty high schoolers are. Why does every outcast in YA have to feel as if they are above whatever's popular in society? It's used far too often. Caitlin was fine, but boring. I ended up liking Tenley's sections the best, because even though she was a mean girl, she was the most interesting to read about. They all kinda blended together by the end, without enough personality differences to make each character distinct. Again, I really just felt as if I was reading a Pretty Little Liars wannabe. I was hoping that the writing would be more mature, but it was still pretty similar to Shepard's. There was too much repetition for my liking. It makes it seem like some YA authors think that teens are too stupid to pick up on little hints, so they have to repeat the same thing over and over. There was a little less brand dropping than in Shepard's books, but I still felt as if the characters were just as shallow. A few edgy ideas came up, such as Tenley flirting with her stepbrother and Sydney's pryromania. But it still all fell flat for me in the end. I did like how the author tried to portray anxiety disorders with Caitlin. Her descriptions of Cait's panic attacks were very realistic, but she kept repeating the same details over and over of her flashbacks. This often happens in real life, but it's not incredibly interesting to read about (especially when the flashbacks are hiding a mystery, it becomes frustrating). This novel isn't all bad, despite my many complaints. If you gave it to me when I was sixteen and obsessed with these types of storylines, maybe I would have liked it more. The love triangle thing between Tenley, Sydney, and Guinness was interesting. I didn't like Guinness's character (he was a jerk), but I wanted to see what happened with him, so he kept me reading more than most of the other plot elements did. The romantic bits were well-written and seemed genuine. And the big reveal, while predictable, had (somewhat) believable motives behind it. Finally, I did actually like that the author killed off one of the main characters. I personally wish it wasn't Caitlin, because I don't think she deserved it, but I commend Green for taking the risk to do it. Many YA authors won't kill off the MCs, even if it would make their books more realistic by doing so. I always wished Sara Shepard would in her books, because I felt as if it would make the stakes so much higher. But, for me, the good parts were not great enough to outweigh the negative aspects of the novel. This book wasn't for me, but others might like it. I do find it really frustrating that this had to be a trilogy. The first book ends with too many loose ends, which I'm assuming will be picked up in the sequel. But after 400 pages, I wish there was more closure. Maybe one day, after I finish reading the Pretty Little Liars books, if I get a craving for trashy YA, I'll pick up the second one. But I doubt it. The pacing was just too off. If the book had been about 150 pages shorter, it might have been a lot better. It was way too slow. I had to skim to make it through this, so I doubt I could make it through the sequel. 2/5 stars.",2,thriller,"['pick', 'truth_dare', 'hope', 'read', 'like', 'teen', 'thriller', 'movie', 'party', 'intense', 'game', 'truth_dare', 'girl', 'menacing', 'note', 'continue', 'game', 'long', 'closure', 'get', 'book', 'home', 'start', 'read', 'realize', 'actually', 'cheap', 'rip', 'pretty', 'little_liars', 'admit', 'like', 'pll', 'book', 'read', 'purely', 'guilty', 'know', 'bad', 'read', 'trashy', 'escape', 'life', 'pretty', 'little_liars', 'fill', 'need', 'bad', 'ya', 'book', 'wanna', 'read', 'copycat', 'hope', 'truth_dare', 'borrow', 'premise', 'well', 'write', 'novel', 'high', 'stake', 'unique', 'twist', 'concept', 'unfortunately', 'let', 'book', 'drag', 'far', 'long', 'end', 'skim', 'section', 'finish', 'book', 'necessarily', 'terrible', 'boring', 'bring', 'absolutely', 'new', 'table', 'game', 'truth_dare', 'hint', 'summary', 'minor', 'last', 'page', 'exciting', 'come', 'dare', 'send', 'anonymous', 'darer', 'lackluster', 'well', 'pretty', 'sort', 'blackmail', 'pll', 'dare', 'dangerous', 'story', 'progress', 'drag', 'far', 'long', 'time', 'thing', 'start', 'get', 'page', 'ready', 'book', 'secret', 'girl', 'protect', 'silly', 'warrant', 'perform', 'life', 'risk', 'task', 'suppose', 'high_schooler', 'live', 'life', 'obsess', 'minute', 'drama', 'feel', 'smart', 'realize', 'drama', 'important', 'risk', 'hurt', 'character', 'alright', 'special', 'literally', 'pair', 'pretty', 'little_liars', 'counterpart', 'tenley', 'rich', 'popular', 'girl', 'hanna', 'shepard', 'book', 'caitlin', 'future', 'harvard', 'student', 'spencer', 'sydney', 'artsy', 'loner', 'aria', 'huge', 'stereotype', 'feel', 'sydney', 'write', 'garner', 'sympathy', 'reader', 'think', 'annoying', 'suppose', 'outcast', 'high_school', 'drama', 'stereotype', 'face', 'like', 'chapter', 'rant', 'stupid', 'pop', 'music', 'petty', 'high_schooler', 'outcast', 'ya', 'feel', 'popular', 'society', 'far', 'caitlin', 'fine', 'boring', 'end', 'like', 'tenley', 'section', 'well', 'mean', 'girl', 'interesting', 'read', 'kinda', 'blend', 'end', 'personality', 'difference', 'character', 'distinct', 'feel', 'read', 'pretty', 'little_liars', 'wannabe', 'hope', 'writing', 'mature', 'pretty', 'similar', 'shepard', 'repetition', 'liking', 'make', 'like', 'ya', 'author', 'think', 'teen', 'stupid', 'pick', 'little', 'hint', 'repeat', 'thing', 'little', 'brand', 'dropping', 'shepard', 'book', 'feel', 'character', 'shallow', 'edgy', 'idea', 'come', 'tenley', 'flirt', 'stepbrother', 'sydney', 'pryromania', 'fall_flat', 'end', 'like', 'author', 'try', 'portray', 'anxiety', 'disorder', 'caitlin', 'description', 'cait', 'panic_attack', 'realistic', 'keep', 'repeat', 'detail', 'flashback', 'happen', 'real', 'life', 'incredibly', 'interesting', 'read', 'especially', 'flashback', 'hide', 'mystery', 'frustrating', 'novel', 'bad', 'despite', 'complaint', 'give', 'sixteen', 'obsess', 'type', 'storyline', 'maybe', 'like', 'love_triangle', 'thing', 'tenley', 'sydney', 'guinness', 'interesting', 'like', 'guinness', 'character', 'jerk', 'want', 'happen', 'keep', 'read', 'plot', 'element', 'romantic', 'bit', 'write', 'genuine', 'big_reveal', 'predictable', 'somewhat', 'believable', 'motive', 'finally', 'actually', 'like', 'author', 'kill', 'main_character', 'personally', 'wish', 'caitlin', 'think', 'deserve', 'commend', 'green', 'take', 'risk', 'ya', 'author', 'will', 'kill', 'mc', 'book', 'realistic', 'wish', 'sara', 'shepard', 'book', 'feel', 'stake', 'high', 'good', 'part', 'great', 'outweigh', 'negative', 'aspect', 'novel', 'book', 'like', 'find', 'frustrating', 'trilogy', 'book', 'end', 'loose_end', 'assume', 'pick', 'sequel', 'page', 'wish', 'closure', 'maybe', 'day', 'finish', 'read', 'pretty', 'little_liars', 'book', 'craving', 'trashy', 'ya', 'pick', 'second', 'doubt', 'pacing', 'book', 'page', 'short', 'lot', 'well', 'way', 'slow', 'skim', 'doubt', 'sequel', 'star']"
369,"3 stars. ""My brain tells me to run because you""re trouble, but my gut tells me something different."" ""What does your gut tell you?"" ""That you""re a lot of trouble."" For all intents and purposes, this was a pretty good book. Cole McGuinnis was an ex-cop turned PI after losing his lover in a shooting, and got roped into investigating the suicide of a Korean businessman, which was how me met Kim Jae-Min. The mystery aspect was well done and engaging, with twists and muders and Cole getting himself into trouble. The cultural backdrop was really interesting. It's not often you find a book with this kind of diversity, and it seems like that auhor did a really good job in her portrayal of Asian-American families. Although the use of Korean terms that were usually left without explanation did make things a bit harder for me since I don't know the language. All characters were likeable, but I have to say Claudia was my favorite. She was a no nonsense kind of woman, and I loved that. Cole was a good lead character, with his own personal struggles and obstacles to overcome on top of the investigation he was doing. Jae, though, was kind of like a damsel in distress most of the time? Getting hurt and having Cole take care of him/want to protect him/etc. Cole and Jae's relationship also lacked development. One word: instalove. The amount of time they spent together didn't validate the strength of their feelings for each other, which made me unable to care much about their relationship. Overall it was a good book, but I was bored sometimes. And I didn't really connect to Cole and Jae, which wasn't good since the entire book is told from Cole's POV. Not sure if I'll continue the series, but we'll see. Series: #1 in the Cole McGinnis series. POV: Told from Cole's POV. Content Warnings: Suicide. Prostitution. Homophobic slurs.

371,"3.5 stars Tucholke's writing is beautiful, lyrical, just the kind of narration I love, and it held it's own up until the end. While the writing pulled me in, I can't justify giving this five or four stars, even though the prose deserves it. The plot was somewhat lacking, which is fine, I love character driven novels, but reading reviews on this ""psychological thriller,"" had me expecting a more exciting ending. The mystery was done well, as were the unreliable characters, but I wanted something more at the end. More of a twist. More of a reason. More worth. Something that left me just as breathless as the prose. Instead, I was left feeling disappointed; feeling that such beautiful writing should be backed by a deserving story, and it could have been if not for the much lacking end. Prose, no matter how well written, cannot hold up a story on it's own. The twist was what made this novel go from a 5 star to a 4 star rating, and the lack of believability/reasoning behind the prank dropped it even lower. I was so hoping for that psychological aspect; that maybe Wink and Poppy were one person, that Midnight was seeing Poppy's ghost, or that Wink and Poppy were really in love. But to find out that it was just a trick by Poppy and Wink, and to not have that justified is frustrating. Why did Wink need to do this? I never got the sense that it was something of great importance, even with the fact that she is supposed to die young--this was underdeveloped, and could have been stated earlier to grant more sympathy and to understand her character a little better. Instead, it was as if Tucholke saved every secret for the end. As in ""Surprise! She's really dead. Oops, just kidding! It was all a trick! Oh, and Wink might die young, but you'll never know."" I can't even say I was awed by the twist, because it lacked so much purpose.",3,thriller,"['star', 'tucholke', 'writing', 'beautiful', 'lyrical', 'kind', 'narration', 'love', 'hold', 'end', 'writing', 'pull', 'justify', 'give_star', 'prose', 'deserve', 'plot', 'somewhat', 'lacking', 'fine', 'love', 'character', 'drive', 'novel', 'read', 'review', 'psychological', 'thriller', 'expect', 'exciting', 'ending', 'mystery', 'unreliable', 'character', 'want', 'end', 'twist', 'reason', 'worth', 'leave', 'breathless', 'prose', 'instead', 'leave', 'feel', 'disappointed', 'feel', 'beautiful', 'writing', 'back', 'deserving', 'story', 'lacking', 'end', 'prose', 'matter', 'write', 'hold', 'story', 'twist', 'novel', 'star', 'star_rating', 'lack', 'believability', 'reasoning', 'prank', 'drop', 'lower', 'hope', 'psychological', 'aspect', 'maybe', 'wink_poppy', 'person', 'midnight', 'see', 'poppy', 'ghost', 'wink_poppy', 'love', 'find', 'trick', 'poppy', 'wink', 'justify', 'frustrating', 'wink', 'need', 'get', 'sense', 'great', 'importance', 'fact', 'suppose', 'die', 'young', 'underdeveloped', 'state', 'early', 'grant', 'sympathy', 'understand', 'character', 'little', 'well', 'instead', 'tucholke', 'save', 'secret', 'end', 'surprise', 'dead', 'oops', 'kid', 'trick', 'oh', 'wink', 'die', 'young', 'know', 'awe', 'twist', 'lack', 'purpose']"
372,"This was not at all what I expected. After loving Dangerous Girls so much, I expected something similar with Dangerous Boys, but boy was I surprised! The story centers around a recent High School Graduate, Chloe, who starts dating Ethan as an escape from home where her mother is depressed. I have to say, Chloe truly did strike me as a good person from page one. She put her college plans on hold, despite wanting nothing more than to leave Haverford, just to care for her unwell Mother. There aren't many teenagers who would put someone else first like that. Even at the end of the story, after seeing a different side to her, I still believe Chloe was a good person who just made some bad decisions. Trouble arises when Ethan's brother Oliver comes to town. Oliver is charming, I'll admit it. Even I started to favor him over Ethan. But that all changes, fairly quickly, when we readers see that Oliver is completely and utterly crazy. Seriously, I went from being totally enchanted by him to actually scared of him- and I'm not often scared of book characters. Was that hunting chapter creepy or what?! This story was so well written. I felt every character was written exactly how they would be in real life- they all reacted to each event exactly how I would expect them to. The only reason I'm giving this four stars instead of five, is this: At the moment when Ethan and Chloe broke up, I felt like Ethan was acting like a completely different person that didn't fit wit the rest of the book. I thought perhaps he'd figured out that Oliver/Chloe were sneaking about behind his back, but realized he hadn't when he walked in on them  but that's my only criticism. I would welcome a sequel to this one. I'd like to see for sure if Chloe is who I think she is, and see how she and the remaining Reznick brother work things out- if they do at all.",4,thriller,"['expect', 'love', 'dangerous', 'girls', 'expect', 'similar', 'dangerous', 'boys', 'boy', 'surprised', 'story', 'center', 'recent', 'high_school', 'graduate', 'chloe', 'starts', 'date', 'ethan', 'escape', 'home', 'mother', 'depressed', 'chloe', 'truly', 'strike', 'good', 'person', 'page', 'college', 'plan', 'hold', 'despite', 'want', 'leave', 'haverford', 'care', 'unwell', 'mother', 'teenager', 'like', 'end', 'story', 'see', 'different', 'believe', 'chloe', 'good', 'person', 'bad', 'decision', 'trouble', 'arise', 'ethan', 'brother', 'oliver', 'come', 'town', 'oliver', 'charming', 'admit', 'start', 'favor', 'ethan', 'change', 'fairly', 'quickly', 'reader', 'oliver', 'completely', 'utterly', 'crazy', 'seriously', 'go', 'totally', 'enchant', 'actually', 'scared', 'scared', 'book', 'character', 'hunting', 'chapter', 'creepy', 'story', 'write', 'feel', 'character', 'write', 'exactly', 'real', 'react', 'event', 'exactly', 'expect', 'reason', 'give_star', 'instead', 'moment', 'ethan', 'chloe', 'break', 'feel', 'like', 'ethan', 'act', 'like', 'completely', 'different', 'person', 'fit', 'wit', 'rest', 'book', 'think', 'figure', 'oliver', 'chloe', 'sneak', 'realize', 'walk', 'criticism', 'welcome', 'sequel', 'like', 'sure', 'chloe', 'think', 'remain', 'reznick', 'brother', 'work', 'thing']"
373,"Gillian Flynn is so skilled at writing unlikable characters, which is the real draw to anything she writes. The ghostly bits are deliciously creepy but I thought the book as a whole ultimately suffered from the brevity of the short story form. The potential explanations at the end came too fast to really pay off, although the final few sentences were still perfectly unsettling in the way one expects from Flynn. (Because I know many people who will care: the first part of the book deals with pretty frank depictions of sexual acts, although they're not really graphic. It was used more for humor, but if you want to avoid that, this probably isn't the book for you.)",4,thriller,"['gillian', 'flynn', 'skilled', 'write', 'unlikable', 'character', 'real', 'draw', 'write', 'ghostly', 'bit', 'deliciously', 'creepy', 'think', 'book', 'ultimately', 'suffer', 'brevity', 'short_story', 'form', 'potential', 'explanation', 'end', 'come', 'fast', 'pay', 'final', 'sentence', 'perfectly', 'unsettling', 'way', 'expect', 'flynn', 'know', 'people', 'care', 'book', 'deal', 'pretty', 'frank', 'depiction', 'sexual', 'act', 'graphic', 'humor', 'want', 'avoid', 'probably', 'book']"

375,"Ahh, so good! So far I've really loved the books I've read by J.L. Merrow. I was a little hesitant to buy this book because its overall stars are lower than I like when buying a book (I generally like to buy 4* books; I've found 3* books to be less reliable in relation to whether I'll like them or not) but I've read Merrow before and I like her stuff, so I trusted her here. It helped that I downloaded a free sample from Amazon and got hooked, although sometimes those free Amazon samples are not to be trusted. I really liked the feel of the book, the way that Paul wasn't sure where he was going or what was going on or what had happened, and often who he could trust or who he couldn't. It made the read very fun for me, and I flew through it like a bird through the sky. I liked the way he worried about whether or not he was reacting appropriately to his amnesia and reacquainting himself to the world around him. I loved discovering Viggo and how Viggo related to Paul, and that Viggo had been saving up to go visit Paul in Britain after Paul's injury. The downside to this book is that I sometimes felt that I shouldn't have liked it as much as I did (the inverse to what I sometimes feel with other books, when I feel like I should like them more than I do), so I would entirely understand if others didn't like this book as much as I did (and I adored it). There were clearly flaws to it. The mystery around what happened before Paul's injury could keep one from connecting to the characters enough to really enjoy the book, for example. The ending where Paul regains all his memories  can seem overly convenient. But honestly, I loved the book to pieces, and GoodReads goes based on how you felt about the book, not based on how good you felt the book objectively is, so I give it all the stars!",5,thriller,"['ahh', 'good', 'far', 'love', 'book', 'read', 'merrow', 'little', 'hesitant', 'buy', 'book', 'overall', 'star', 'low', 'like', 'buy', 'book', 'generally', 'like', 'buy', 'book', 'find', 'book', 'reliable', 'relation', 'like', 'read', 'merrow', 'like', 'stuff', 'trust', 'help', 'download', 'free', 'sample', 'amazon', 'got', 'hook', 'free', 'amazon', 'sample', 'trust', 'like', 'feel', 'book', 'way', 'paul', 'sure', 'go', 'go', 'happen', 'trust', 'read', 'fun', 'fly', 'like', 'bird', 'sky', 'like', 'way', 'worry', 'react', 'appropriately', 'amnesia', 'reacquaint', 'world', 'love', 'discover', 'viggo', 'viggo', 'relate', 'paul', 'viggo', 'save', 'visit', 'paul', 'britain', 'paul', 'injury', 'downside', 'book', 'feel', 'like', 'inverse', 'feel', 'book', 'feel', 'like', 'like', 'entirely', 'understand', 'like', 'book', 'adore', 'clearly', 'flaw', 'mystery', 'happen', 'paul', 'injury', 'connect', 'character', 'enjoy', 'book', 'example', 'ending', 'paul', 'regain', 'memory', 'overly', 'convenient', 'honestly', 'love', 'book', 'piece', 'goodreads', 'go', 'base', 'feel', 'book', 'base', 'good', 'feel', 'book', 'objectively', 'star']"

378,"I decided to get myself a library card, and this was the first book I chose to read. The cover drew me, and then when I saw it was set in Japan and written by a Japanese writer, I knew that I had to at least try. The summary made it clear that it wasn't going to be a simple book, but I was ready for the challenge. But I just never expected this book to break my hear, and change the way I see the world completely. This book is divided to very few chapters, and each of them is told from the point of view of one of the main characters: A group of four teenage girls and worm, a guy the same age as them. This is more of a philosophical book, that shows what we usually enjoy swiping under the rag. Voyeurism, self destruction, depression, sexual behavior. And everything is told through teenagers. And let's face it, adults love pretending that their children are innocent and that our world is simple, and our biggest problems are what we're going to wear to school, our grads, and whether or not a certain person likes us. But teenagers are probably the most complex people around, because we don't know much and we haven't seen much, but some of us had seen things that most people would never experience. On the surface, Toshi and Terauchi look like the more complex girls, but in a way, they all are. Yuzan is dealing with the death of her mother while trying to hide her sexuality. Kirarin's heart was broken by her first boyfriend, and she since had decided that being with a lot of guys might make her feel better and would make her life more exciting. Terauchi found out that her mother cheated on her father, and that shattered the glass that shielded her childish innocent and threw her harshly into the world of adults. They're all dealing with problems, and they all do it alone. Worm, even though he basically the reason this whole story started, feels like a really minor character. He's the instrument that helps the girls acknowledging their issues, but necessarily in a good way. This is a book that start with a matricide, continues with assistance to a fugitive and ends with a death in a car accident and suicide. It's a hard book to connect with because it's hard to accept the simple truth everything is written in. We all want to believe that the world isn't all that terrible, but it's not true. And the writer isn't trying to sugar coat everything, or write in some sophisticated way about pain and suffering. It's just a sad story about a group of people who ruin themselves till the point of no return.",3,thriller,"['decide', 'library', 'card', 'book', 'choose', 'read', 'cover', 'draw', 'see', 'set', 'japan', 'write', 'japanese', 'writer', 'know', 'try', 'summary', 'clear', 'go', 'simple', 'book', 'ready', 'challenge', 'expect', 'book', 'break', 'hear', 'change', 'way', 'world', 'completely', 'book', 'divide', 'chapter', 'tell', 'point_view', 'main_character', 'group', 'teenage', 'girl', 'worm', 'guy', 'age', 'philosophical', 'book', 'show', 'usually', 'enjoy', 'swipe', 'rag', 'voyeurism', 'self', 'destruction', 'depression', 'sexual', 'behavior', 'tell', 'teenager', 'let', 'face', 'adult', 'love', 'pretend', 'child', 'innocent', 'world', 'simple', 'big', 'problem', 'go', 'wear', 'school', 'grad', 'certain', 'person', 'like', 'teenager', 'probably', 'complex', 'people', 'know', 'see', 'see', 'thing', 'people', 'experience', 'surface', 'toshi', 'terauchi', 'look', 'like', 'complex', 'girl', 'way', 'yuzan', 'deal', 'death', 'mother', 'try', 'hide', 'sexuality', 'kirarin', 'heart_break', 'boyfriend', 'decide', 'lot', 'guy', 'feel', 'well', 'life', 'exciting', 'terauchi', 'find', 'mother', 'cheat', 'father', 'shatter', 'glass', 'shield', 'childish', 'innocent', 'throw', 'harshly', 'world', 'adult', 'deal', 'problem', 'worm', 'basically', 'reason', 'story', 'start', 'feel', 'like', 'minor_character', 'instrument', 'help', 'girl', 'acknowledge', 'issue', 'necessarily', 'good', 'way', 'book', 'start', 'matricide', 'continue', 'assistance', 'fugitive', 'end', 'death', 'car', 'accident', 'suicide', 'hard', 'book', 'connect', 'hard', 'accept', 'simple', 'truth', 'write', 'want', 'believe', 'world', 'terrible', 'true', 'writer', 'try', 'sugar', 'coat', 'write', 'sophisticated', 'way', 'pain', 'suffering', 'sad', 'story', 'group', 'people', 'ruin', 'till', 'point', 'return']"
379,"Sometimes it is so damn hard to put your mindspace in the right place to enjoy a piece so far out of your frame, and this is definitely one of those books. I knew a bit of what I might expect, after all, I did enjoy reading Drood and so I got a real hankering to read an actual extremely popular novel by such a wild character in a modern book about Wilkie and Charles. But that's neither here nor there. I probably wouldn't have ever picked this one up without it, though. On to the novel at hand. It's a mystery! And if I can believe wikipedia, it's one of the very first ever written, and considered to be one of the top 100 novels ever written! Whoopie! I mean, that's all great and all. But did I enjoy it? Actually... I did. To a degree. Of course, the mental gymnastics were pretty strenuous. After all, I have to suspend belief that Laura was NOT TSTL. Tstl? Yes. Tstl. Every step of the way, she made the most horrible decisions, either by not listening to her heart or not having a brain in her head. If this were a mystery novel of even 20 years after its written date of 1854, we'd have killed this one off like a redshirt for sure. Therefore, I am UTTERLY AMAZED by the ending. I've never seen such brilliant contrivance to make such an unlikable airhead pull through to the very end, have her love, her fortune, and her unwitting revenge upon all who had assailed her. I mean, WOW. Wilkie Collins is a MASTER. That being said, I thought the Count was pretty much awesome. Everyone except for Laura and Walter managed to transform themselves from cardboard cutouts into genuine people full of both good and bad. Sometimes the descriptions were cumbersome and made me wish for a bit of a Hemingway Edit, but that's a complaint I can make about any of the literature of that day. There was one notable exception. I loved our enlightenment of Count Fosco's animals. It's details like this that turn a sensational-ish novel into something a bit more memorable. I swear, though: Laura was consistently tstl. Thank GOD for her half-sister. Miss Halcombe was pretty damn awesome from start to finish, and I agree 100% with the Count's esteem of her. The one thing I cannot be more pleased about, after finishing this, is the fact that there wasn't some long-drawn-out court scene so reminiscent of modern police drama or mysteries. We had the hint of it in the beginning, and it could have gone that way, but I can't be happier with the outcome as it actually occurred. There was a hell of a lot of expanded plot in this novel, and it was all so logical and well thought out. I'm just so damn AMAZED that the whole society in which they lived was actually able to FUNCTION, ya know? How could people trust each other as much as they did? How could people be so INNOCENT? I mean, really? Really? Was it a function of the black and white nature of the novels of the time to pop all of these features out at us in stark and glowing detail? Or was it just Wilkie? Or was it in actual fact, a real piece of the society in which they all lived? I'm primarily a sf/f/horror fan, but I truly HAVE read a ton of traditional classics. And yet, I'm still forced to set myself into a Victorian England as if it is some truly alien society so foreign and strange to us. It's funny. I should know better.

380,"This book is enchanting. That's the first thing I admit. These are why: the cover design brings the mood already; that whimsical title; and the author's name that rings a bell (turns out I have her anthology book on my TBR list). It drew me like a magnet yes, I was drawn. I don't mean to compare the quality per se, but I personally can relate this book to my previously read novel, This Is How the World Ends by Amy Zhang. Like, similar. Both of them were marvelous in writing style. The feelings were different though, but I sensed the same fairy tale, under-the-spell kind of atmosphere even though both of them are completely contemporary, don't be tricked . Magical realism, if I'm to take the 'modern' term. I can't lie--I was mesmerized the whole journey. The words took me to another realm, yet I could sense it through my own skin. It was real and dreamy at the same time, definitely my kind of favorite read. I felt the same way with TIHtWE. No matter how bizzare it turned out and how confused I was in the end, I still devoured the story and let the characters take me wherever they lead me. I believe it was also because of the short chapters and strong voices for Wink, Poppy, and Midnight. I read the author's interview that she initially wrote only Wink and Midnight's PoVs, but her critique partner suggested to write Poppy's also, and she enjoyed writing Poppy the most. And I could feel that. Poppy was the easiest narrator to read to despite the fact that she was the most annoying. I mean, who proclaims themselves proudly as bullies? Contrary to some opinion about poetic-words-no-plot, I could actually see the highs and lows of the story, the red herrings and twist and climax. No complains about it. Although it's true that the wordings took more place than actual action so it looked like a bunch of beautiful passages describing settings, and pretty quotable sentence coming from characters sounded unnatural, it wasn't what made it receive three-star rating instead of 'perfect' four stars. It was this. Why was Wink quickly forgiven?! I got why they do that. But I didn't get that one only. It was just too fast, too happy-ending a la fairy tales that Wink memorized outside her head. I didn't understand why they had to pretend the whole seance so that they (or Wink) can burn the house and scare the hell out of the Yellows and Midnight. The scenario was too big and risky for a simple reward, and what's with Hero and Villain after all? And now if I read a pitch with We Were Liars comparison in it, it's definitely, surely, absolutely about the fire. My favorite character was Leaf. I liked him form the start and I wish he came up more often. His personality was strong even though he didn't really present on the story, just from Poppy's tale. He was the real male lead character I wanted to see instead of Midnight. (One more thing... Midnight's habit to always tell about his family and their pet peeves and their preferences in the middle of something even if it didn't add to the plot. Was it important to insert chara trivia like that, or was it just the way Midnight speaks set by the author so his vulnerability was shown ad sounded different?) I enjoyed this. I truly did. I was just bothered by 'that' one thing that managed to ruin a half of the book.

In this book, I really enjoyed meeting Kara and exploring her insider's view of prestidigitation.

More details were revealed regarding Ben and it was a surprised that it wasn't more well-known. Jae revealed more regarding his family. His mother did not sound like a real motherly not to mention she seemed to hardly had any redeeming quality. It seemed like she could compare notes to Cole's parents.

383,"Mind of Winter would have been much more successful as a novella (it reminds me very much of ""The Turn of the Screw""); its beginning and end were fantastic, and they will haunt me for months. Kasischke is a master at creating scenes that elicit high emotion (dread, fear, horror, sorrow) from her readers, and she should trust her images and scenes instead of piling words on top of words on top of words to over-describe them. The narrator became nearly insufferable as the novel progressed, and if I had to read about the narrator encountering and waxing poetic about that stupid latch on Tatiana's stupid door one more time, I was going to break down both the fourth wall and the flimsily latched door.

384,"I enjoyed this, though not as much as Gone Girl. It was a little disturbing, and I found it hard to picture what Camille even looked like, since  I can't imagine a person with scars of words all over their body. I thought it was a little predictable, in that I did guess part of the end, but not the entire thing, pretty early on, but I still thought it was an enjoyable read and it was really unique. Sometimes, I think it's okay to have a predictable story as long as it's told in a unique way with good writing that keeps you reading, and that's what this was. Like most mystery/thrillers, it's pretty easy to point to one or two people and say ""Aha! You're the killer!"" For this genre especially, if my standard was that the book would only be good if it wasn't predictable, I think I'd have to stop reading these books entirely, because I almost always guess who the killer is pretty early in.

385,"I went into Please Don't Tell not knowing what it would be about, and I do not regret it one bit. Reading it reminded me how important it is to read out of your comfort zone, even if it is a genre I would have never picked up! Please Don't Tell follows Joy and Grace, twins that are surprisingly very different from each other. Although Joy is a little obnoxious, she views herself as a protector, both of her sister and her friends. Grace on the other hand is a straight A student, and there's no doubt in anyone's mind that she'll be going to college. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Joy. The POV not only switches between the sisters, but it also switches between the past and the present (or more accurately, the ""before"" and ""after""). In Joy's POV, we see her struggling to not only deal with the aftermath of Adam's death, but also a blackmailer who apparently saw her murder Adam. In order for the blackmailer to not turn her in, Joy has to pretty much do whatever the blackmailer says. In Grace's POV, we see how the sisters were before, which was vastly different from the present. I had much less tolerance for Joy then, and Grace was like me in high school. Always studying, never really breaking out of her shell. Not until Joy comes along to drag her off to be a party animal. To be honest, this is a very hard review to write because I don't want to spoil anyone. I went into this book completely blind, not knowing it dealt with a some hard topics, along with it being a mystery. The most I can say is that I kept on trying to guess who the blackmailer was (and failed to guess right). I really was just pointing fingers at everyone. Most importantly, I loved how we can clearly see the changes in both Joy and Grace after what happened. It reminded me a little of The Way I Used To Be, where one event can completely transform a person, for better or for worse. I can't hold it in, so highlight for spoilers! Let's talk about the reveal! I think something in me knew it would be Grace, although I was stuck on the blackmailer being Preston for a very long time (hey you never know). But wow, I can't believe her own twin sister blackmailed her! Makes me really glad that I don't have any siblings, though I'm sure that would never happen haha. I feel like the last half of the novel was much more fast paced, as the beginning was a little slow for me. But very much worth it. I really enjoyed Please Don't Tell, even though it doesn't seem like a Val book at all. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good mystery, or likes reading about darker topics.

I had high hopes (like Corrupt high hopes which blow my mind) but unfortunately it wasn't crazy enough, fucked up enough, insane enough... Although I liked Madison, I found her immature. Actually that goes for the other characters too. Their personalities were rather simple. About the ending... finally something I didn't expect. Still what the hell is The Silver Swan?

I don't need to know what every church he visits at reminds him of, and what childhood nightmares he's still suffering from if it's irrelevant to the plot.

388,"https://anaslair.wordpress.com/2017/0... I struggled with suspension of belief on this one. I just did not get how someone could be fully conscious and no doctors realise it. Surely there are brain exams that were performed where the brain activity would be noticeable? Also, she needs a machine to breathe for her but somehow she is able to identify scents and she has her eyes open (who has their eyes open in a vegetative state??) and is able to focus on details such as a doctor's open pores but no change occurs in her eyes? It took me a while to warm up to it but once I did, about halfway in or so, I flipped the pages as quickly as I could. I enjoyed how the narrative was presented, with different voices - even little Evie's - and mysterious character(s). The suspense built up. Then at the beginning of the last fifth of the story we get the much advertised shocking plot twist (I truly dislike seeing that by the way, it was even in my ARC book title). It is shocking indeed but I for one did not find it believable at all. There was nothing in that character's past or later explained that would justify that she would view Evie as her own. Actually, pretty much the only background we get is that she had money issues . Only when I got to the end did I notice I had read a previous novel by the same author and had felt pretty much the same. The books are so emotionally and psychologically charged that the characters' actions need to be properly backed up and I just don't feel it happens. It's almost as if the book is done for shock purpose, all explanations for what had happened felt that way, as well as extremely rushed, and I have to say I don't really appreciate that.

389,"I found myself with an odd sense of deja-vu throughout the reading of this collection. I've also just finished Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, and so comparisons are inevitable. Both books deal in part with the abuse, torture, rape and murder of women. However, where King excels far above Larsson is his depiction of ""ordinary people in extra-ordinary situations"". His characters are believable, and I found that he evoked more emotion in 100 or so pages than Larsson did in his entire book. The female characters - Tess and Darcy - in their respective stories, are both kickass and completely ordinary. These stories are dark, ""harsh"" - King himself admits they were hard to write. However, they are not without hope. There are - please excuse the awful pun - a few stars left in the dark at the end of the last three stories at least - I will admit I found none in the first. For example, Tess's life may be irrevocably changed after not only being raped, but committing three somewhat brutal murders. However the end of the story indicates that she will recover, in time. Same with Darcy (who I felt the most sorry for, in the end. Her story came across as the most believable, maybe that's why). On the (ever so slightly) bright side, Fair Extension is darkly humorous in its portrayal of a man who sells not his own soul, but another man's life to the devil (or ""Elvid"").

But once the story unfolds, I inevitably got caught up in it: in the borderline relationships among the protagonists, in the swirling of raw emotions and their inevitable conclusion.

391,"According to the dust jacket, The Retribution is ""the ideal introduction or reintroduction to the world of Tony Hill and Carol Jordan."" Well bloody hell, if this had been my first outing with Tony and Carol, I don't think I'd be coming back for more. McDermid's books have always been shocking - borderline grotesque in places - but for me, the stakes were just too high here. Carol's brother murdered, Tony's beloved house razed to the ground, Chris blinded and horrifically scarred for life... Often I can't put McDermid's book down. This one I had to put aside in favour of watching a few hours of How I Met Your Mother, because it was just too flipping grim. Not to mention the Tony/Carol element. After a few books of total stagnation in their relationship, the last instalment gave me some hope for forward momentum. And instead, here we take a step back so enormous, it's hard to see how the lost ground can ever be recovered. On the whole, it's hard to say I enjoyed this book, because it was just so distressing. The pacing in the second half was tense, edge of seat stuff, but the first few hundred pages were dismayingly slow - particularly when we spent a chapter with Vance escaping, a chapter with Tony learning Vance had escaped, then a chapter with Tony telling Carol Vance had escaped...

I grabbed it because it was half price and I loved Libba Bray's Great and Terrible Beauty trilogy, but I'd never been certain enough of Going Bovine to actually get it until it was that or twiddle my thumbs on a dozen different trains. I mean, there's a cow on the cover. That's kind of not me at all. It started off okay... I was a little unsure, Cam's voice was just a bit too much at times, a little over the top/try-hard or something, I wasn't sure if I liked the way it was written/told. But I was still at least curious, the story seemed an interesting enough one. And then it started to get really, really weird. Like, fire giants and shit. And I was thinking three stars, maybe two if it went even further like this. I mean, it was all too much and so not ME. But then... it actually started to grow on me. I loved Gonzo and Balder, and the road trip was really exciting - the whole following random shit which made me go wtf at first started to build up a lot, and the places they went to were, for the most part, really interesting. I had a mild thought in the middle that it was probably all going to just be a dream, since Cameron kept having dreams of being in the hospital, but then it began to just be SO real that I knew he really was on this road trip, you know? Everything was so detailed and so realistic, his parents/sister calling him etc - even the weird fantasy shit felt real. And Dulcie, omg Dulcie. Such a crush on her! I was really shipping her and Cam and I don't usually do that. The universe just felt like a bizarre one where this could all happen - I mean the SPEW tests at school were real, so why not the snow globes?

394,"This is a tricky one to rate because I found Will's story fascinating, his interpretation of the world before his surgery and his adjustments afterwards, realizing that he needs to learn how to see and interpret what he's seeing with how he's always learned without sight before was all very interesting. And it seems well researched, though I still don't know how accurate Will's descriptions of blindness and experiences might actually be since the author himself has never been blind. But I enjoyed reading about Will. But I didn't actually like Will or much of the rest of the book. Will fat-shames the vice-principal and grabs a girl's boob (by accident but brushes it off as being totally acceptable because he didn't mean to and he is blind, after all, but thoroughly enjoys being able to get away with these things because he's blind and doesn't even apologize) all in the first chapter.

In fact, he makes his mom stay outside in the car during his pre-op appointment where the procedure is explained and most of his post-op therapy sessions, even the ones when his medications are changed yet Will describes her as a helicopter parent. But I don't see that behavior anywhere. I cannot imagine my mom being okay sending me into those appointments on my own. Also, I don't believe for a second that she would sell her brand new car for thousands less than what it's worth to fund a road trip for her son and his friends when her husband is a fancy doctor. Are there no other funds? Is there no credit card she can send with him? How about a debit card? Or sell the car to a dealer? I don't know but there are about a thousand other ways I'd find to do this before doing it that way. Though I do fully support her wanting her son to see the world at this moment in the story. But the selling of the Tesla for cash to a fellow country club member just doesn't fit. So overall, the story was interesting and the writing was fine, it just wasn't what I had hoped for. I was excited for an interesting look at the definitions of traditional beauty from someone who hasn't been inundated with these ""beautiful"" images all his life. I wanted him to grandstand about how unfair society is to those who don't conform or who are born different. But I seemed to get more of a childish tantrum over something else ( Cecily failing to mention to her new friend Will that she has a birthmark covering half of her face? When all Cecily wants after a lifetime of being made fun of is someone who doesn't notice her birthmark right away and wants to fit in, just list Will who doesn't like to wear sunglasses inside and freaks out when he finds out people saw him go into the girls' bathroom. ) instead. I wanted more meaningful relationships between Will and his parents and his new friends. And while the moments between Cecily and Will were among my favorite (tantrum not included), I really wish she had been more developed as a character. That they all had been more developed and complex and been given more time to really deal with the issues the book tried to address. But overall, it just fell short for me.",2,young_adult,"['tricky', 'rate', 'find', 'story', 'fascinating', 'interpretation', 'world', 'surgery', 'adjustment', 'realize', 'need', 'learn', 'interpret', 'see', 'learn', 'sight', 'interesting', 'research', 'know', 'accurate', 'description', 'blindness', 'experience', 'actually', 'author', 'blind', 'enjoy', 'read', 'actually', 'like', 'rest', 'book', 'fat', 'shame', 'vice', 'principal', 'grab', 'girl', 'boob', 'accident', 'brush', 'totally', 'acceptable', 'mean', 'blind', 'thoroughly_enjoy', 'able', 'away', 'thing', 'blind', 'apologize', 'chapter', 'improve', 'think', 'enjoy', 'cecily', 'explain', 'art', 'perspective', 'thing', 'world', 'cecily', 'rest', 'character', 'flat', 'underdeveloped', 'parent', 'little', 'place', 'depend', 'scene', 'need', 'work', 'story', 'fact', 'make', 'mom', 'stay', 'outside', 'car', 'pre', 'op', 'appointment', 'procedure', 'explain', 'post', 'op', 'therapy', 'session', 'one', 'medication', 'change', 'describe', 'helicopter', 'parent', 'behavior', 'imagine', 'mom', 'okay', 'send', 'appointment', 'believe', 'second', 'sell', 'brand', 'new', 'car', 'thousand', 'worth', 'fund', 'road_trip', 'son', 'friend', 'husband', 'fancy', 'doctor', 'fund', 'credit', 'card', 'send', 'debit', 'card', 'sell', 'car', 'dealer', 'know', 'thousand', 'way', 'find', 'way', 'fully', 'support', 'want', 'son', 'world', 'moment', 'story', 'selling', 'tesla', 'cash', 'fellow', 'country', 'club', 'member', 'fit', 'overall', 'story', 'interesting', 'writing', 'fine', 'hope', 'excited', 'interesting', 'look', 'definition', 'traditional', 'beauty', 'inundate', 'beautiful', 'image', 'life', 'want', 'grandstand', 'unfair', 'society', 'conform', 'bear', 'different', 'childish', 'tantrum', 'cecily', 'fail', 'mention', 'new', 'friend', 'birthmark', 'cover', 'half', 'face', 'cecily', 'want', 'lifetime', 'fun', 'notice', 'birthmark', 'right_away', 'want', 'fit', 'list', 'like', 'wear', 'sunglass', 'inside', 'freak', 'find', 'people', 'see', 'girl', 'bathroom', 'instead', 'want', 'meaningful', 'relationship', 'parent', 'new', 'friend', 'moment', 'cecily', 'favorite', 'tantrum', 'include', 'wish', 'developed', 'character', 'developed', 'complex', 'give', 'time', 'deal', 'issue', 'book', 'try', 'address', 'overall', 'fall', 'short']"

In the beginning I was cringing: we had a deeply introverted young woman who valued her internet friends and who above all loved to write, and the last thing I wanted was for that to all change in the name of ""character development"", as though being introverted and having internet friends and loving to write was something that was wrong and needed fixing.

396,"I think the only saving grace of Requiem was it's predecessors. I loved Delirium and Pandemonium so much that I HAD to know the outcome, and I already loved the world and characters. However, I'm going to say it... this was the worst end to a dystopia that I have ever read. And it hurts me to say that after I had been SO impressed with the other books. There are a couple of things I liked: I liked having Hana's insider POV. I finally felt like I understood how the cure changed people. However, her POV mostly didn't advance the plot at all, so it felt useless. I also loved the fact that Lena is still a relateable character. I understand her emotions, and the way she handles jealousy and throwing herself at one boy to make the other jealous, it felt like something a teenager would actually do. Lena's strength comes in ordinary ways, through courage and loyalty to her beliefs. She didn't go all ""Mockingjay"" - meaning, she wasn't turned into the one and only possible savior of the Resistance. She was simply a player, involved, but not on the main lines. I actually appreciated her small part in the battles because it was more believable to me than the endings of other popular dystopia series. What I had the biggest problem with was that NOTHING GOT RESOLVED. We have been building a love story, and a government resistance conflict for 3 books now. Neither of these things gets the attention it deserves. The 'love triangle' I was expecting was non existent, as one guy dropped out on page one. Then Lena's surviving relationship was fueled by leftover feelings it seemed. And in the end when she finally ends up with somebody, it's so lacing in anticipation, they are just like 'ok, we're together now'. None of it was satisfying to me, neither guy got the attention that a story about fighting for love deserved. I think both Julian and Alex supporters will be ultimately let down. As for the Resistance aspect of the story... it was the main focus and the action scenes were the best in my opinion. They were the only times I felt exctied and gripped. But I really hated how this book ended. Not that it had a 'bad' ending, just that the main conflict was one battle, in one city. We don't even get to find out what impact this had on that city's leaders, much less the rest of the country. We really don't know what the outcome will be. Even worse, I felt no closure with any of the characters, not even the two narrators. What will be the fallout of the love triangle? What the heck happened to Hana? What will happen to Lena and her whole group, where will they go now? Will the government topple and the cure be eradicated? One of the biggest disappointments to me was Raven. In her short story it was revealed that  she was pregnant. This is never mentioned in Requiem! And then something happens... and there is just NO closure to her storyline at all. Overall this book felt like a lead up to a conclusion, like there should be a fourth book. It would rate higher with me if that were the case, but as the finale, it fell flat.",3,young_adult,"['think', 'saving', 'grace', 'requiem', 'predecessor', 'love', 'delirium', 'pandemonium', 'know', 'outcome', 'love', 'world', 'character', 'go', 'bad', 'end', 'dystopia', 'read', 'hurt', 'impressed', 'book', 'couple', 'thing', 'like', 'like', 'have', 'hana', 'insider', 'pov', 'finally', 'feel', 'like', 'understand', 'cure', 'change', 'people', 'pov', 'advance', 'plot', 'feel', 'useless', 'love', 'fact', 'lena', 'relateable', 'character', 'understand', 'emotion', 'way', 'handle', 'jealousy', 'throw', 'boy', 'jealous', 'feel', 'like', 'teenager', 'actually', 'lena', 'strength', 'come', 'ordinary', 'way', 'courage', 'loyalty', 'belief', 'mockingjay', 'mean', 'turn', 'possible', 'savior', 'resistance', 'simply', 'player', 'involve', 'main', 'line', 'actually', 'appreciate', 'small', 'battle', 'believable', 'ending', 'popular', 'dystopia', 'series', 'big', 'problem', 'got', 'resolve', 'build', 'love', 'story', 'government', 'resistance', 'conflict', 'book', 'thing', 'get', 'attention', 'deserve', 'love_triangle', 'expect', 'non', 'existent', 'guy', 'drop', 'page', 'lena', 'survive', 'relationship', 'fuel', 'leftover', 'feeling', 'end', 'finally', 'end', 'somebody', 'lace', 'anticipation', 'like', 'ok', 'satisfying', 'guy', 'get', 'attention', 'story', 'fight', 'love', 'deserve', 'think', 'julian', 'alex', 'supporter', 'ultimately', 'let', 'resistance', 'aspect', 'story', 'main', 'focus', 'action', 'scene', 'good', 'opinion', 'time', 'feel', 'exctie', 'grip', 'hate', 'book', 'end', 'bad', 'ending', 'main', 'conflict', 'battle', 'city', 'find', 'impact', 'city', 'leader', 'rest', 'country', 'know', 'outcome', 'worse', 'feel', 'closure', 'character', 'narrator', 'fallout', 'love_triangle', 'heck', 'happen', 'hana', 'happen', 'lena', 'group', 'government', 'topple', 'cure', 'eradicate', 'big', 'disappointment', 'raven', 'short_story', 'reveal', 'pregnant', 'mention', 'requiem', 'happen', 'closure', 'storyline', 'overall', 'book', 'feel', 'like', 'lead', 'conclusion', 'like', 'fourth', 'book', 'rate', 'higher', 'case', 'finale', 'fall_flat']"

399,"Challenge #17  A book a friend recommended (popsugar 2015 reading challenge: http://tinyurl.com/mmbkthd) I think this book broke me Update: This book was recommended to me by Raeleen What to say about this book? It is a weird mixture of contemporary and science fiction. I feel like this book should be like oil and vinegar, where the two elements of this book don't work. However, this is not the case! Adam Silvera was able to make a dark drama about a boy trying to figure out who he is. I compare this book to darker Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (which is a fantastic movie) mixed with the love story of Ian and Mickey from Shameless. The information and development of the story is so carefully revealed so that the reader doesn't know what is going on until Silvera wants you to know what is going on. The main character is an asshole. He has a lot of horrible things happen to him, but he tends to blame the wrong things. He messes up all of the people around him, but doesn't really give them a second thought. His love is shown in strange ways, and he just can't really comprehend his feelings. I didn't think Aaron is a good person, but that doesn't mean I don't like him. I got so attached to his character, by the end I was crying because his life was so crappy and I wanted him to be happy. This book is a lot of things: a love story, a coming of age story, and a poverty story. It was able to pull of my emotions so much for such a small book. I definitely recommend it, and it will be on my favorites shelf for years to come! Spoliers: The horrible ways Aaron is treated throughout the book are realistic in a poverty ridden place. The reason why I love this book was it took a coming out story and put a science fiction twist on it. Adam Silvera used the treatment that he made up in a realistic way, which is what gave the book so much depth. The prejudice against gay people and homosexuality is such a known concept, that a gay boy who was raised with those ideals would jump at the chance of turning himself straight. Adam Silvera is making a pretty big statement on what our society thinks towards sexuality, and how in this new age of technology it could severely go wrong. The book is a very good comment on sexuality, and it is aparent that Adam Silvera is very passionate about it!",5,young_adult,"['challenge', 'book', 'friend', 'recommend', 'popsugar', 'reading', 'challenge', 'think', 'book', 'break', 'update', 'book', 'recommend', 'raeleen', 'book', 'weird', 'mixture', 'contemporary', 'science_fiction', 'feel', 'like', 'book', 'like', 'oil', 'vinegar', 'element', 'book', 'work', 'case', 'adam_silvera', 'able', 'dark', 'drama', 'boy', 'try_figure', 'compare', 'book', 'dark', 'eternal', 'sunshine', 'spotless', 'mind', 'fantastic', 'movie', 'mix', 'love', 'story', 'ian', 'mickey', 'shameless', 'information', 'development', 'story', 'carefully', 'reveal', 'reader', 'know', 'go', 'silvera', 'want', 'know', 'go', 'main_character', 'asshole', 'lot', 'horrible', 'thing', 'happen', 'tend', 'blame', 'wrong', 'thing', 'mess', 'people', 'second', 'thought', 'love', 'show', 'strange', 'way', 'comprehend', 'feeling', 'think', 'aaron', 'good', 'person', 'mean', 'like', 'get', 'attached', 'character', 'end', 'cry', 'life', 'crappy', 'want', 'happy', 'book', 'lot', 'thing', 'love', 'story', 'come', 'age', 'story', 'poverty', 'story', 'able', 'pull', 'emotion', 'small', 'book', 'definitely_recommend', 'favorite', 'shelf', 'year', 'come', 'spolier', 'horrible', 'way', 'aaron', 'treat', 'book', 'realistic', 'poverty', 'ride', 'place', 'reason', 'love', 'book', 'take', 'coming', 'story', 'science_fiction', 'twist', 'adam_silvera', 'treatment', 'realistic', 'way', 'give', 'book', 'depth', 'prejudice', 'gay', 'people', 'homosexuality', 'know', 'concept', 'gay', 'boy', 'raise', 'ideal', 'jump', 'chance', 'turn', 'straight', 'adam_silvera', 'make', 'pretty', 'big', 'statement', 'society', 'think', 'sexuality', 'new', 'age', 'technology', 'severely', 'wrong', 'book', 'good', 'comment', 'sexuality', 'aparent', 'adam_silvera', 'passionate']"
400,"4 stars. This book is exactly what I needed after reading really huge, intense fantasy novels. This book is light and fun but it also expertly hides deeper scenes and important moments in coming out to your friends, family, and to your school. Simon was a great main character. His wit and humor had me laughing but he was also incredibly smart and really understood all his emotions. I appreciated that in his character. This is a minor issue but Simon says the word ""freaking"" way too much. I know he is seventeen but I was getting so annoyed with how much he used that word, I know it's a nitpick. I really enjoyed all the characters, actually. I think they fit the story well and weren't just ""plot moving characters"". I think that they fulfilled their purpose and I genuinely liked all the characters. So, I figured out who the mysterious ""Blue"" was about halfway through the book. Just from the way Simon would describe this character, I knew he was ""Blue"". When Simon realizes who it is and they have their meeting, it couldn't have been more cute. I loved this pairing. I also really loved that it is a interracial couple. I was happy that we got resolution with Leah. For awhile I was worried that Simon and Leah were not going to talk again and I was happy that they talked and forgave each other in the end. The Martin situation, however, I can completely see why Simon is still angry with him. I was happy that Martin apologized in the email and I can see a friendship for them in the future. I would recommend this to anyone who has a pulse, honestly. It's light but really deep and opened my eyes to new things.

401,"I can't believe I finished The Giver, Gathering Blue, and The Messenger, all within the same night! The first time I read these, there was a span of several years between my reading and I can honestly say that you get so much more out of these when you read them back to back. I like that we finally find out what happens to Jonas and there is a brief mention of Gabe (who will finally get his own story in  Son ). While I enjoyed the book overall, it did leave me with some kingering questions. Jonas mentions that he receives a barge filled with books as a ""gift"" from his old city. That confused me completely because a.) How would they know the books would find him? and b.) If their society really was getting better, why would they willingly part with thousands of books? We were led to believe that the Giver was one of the only citizens with books so why would he part with them willingly?? I guess the librarian part of me can't understand loading your book collection on a barge and sending it off down a river. I thought maybe the society was regressing and the books were sent away to ""save"" them...but I'm probably overthinking it! I also wondered what happened to his sister Lily. Jonas/Leader makes an offhanded comment about missing her. We just know so much more about the changes within Kira's village but we only get tiny speculations about Jonas's. I'm really hoping that the next book will let us know what has happened there. The other thing that bothered me about this book was that the Trade Mart situation was never really dealt with. While Matty was able to heal the forest and the people within the Village, the lasting effects of his sacrifice are debatable. There was no interaction with the sinister trader man and his black book so it makes you wonder if the same situation would eventually play out again when he eventually comes back. I just hate that Lowry's endings are always so fast! You finally figure out what's going on, the problem is solved, and it's over! I tend to like more ""and this is what happened next."" I do think that her style does leave you with unanswered questions, and this is why these books have been talked about for years and years.

402,"This review was originally posted on Bedtime Bookworm Loving Patrick Ness! I've been fairly obsessed with Patrick Ness ever since I read the Choas Walking trilogy back in October of last year. I wasn't planning on reading more Patrick Ness so soon, but one day I was at the library picking up a different book when I saw this one out of the corner of my eye. It was calling my name and I couldn't resist checking it out right then and there. I'm so glad that I did because I loved this book. I went into this book pretty much completely blind - and that's how I recommend you go into it as well! All I knew was it was about a boy who died and wakes up, which happens in the very first chapter. I recommend going into the book knowing only that because I personally enjoyed all the surprises in store for me as I went along. Therefore, I'm using a lot of spoiler tags in this review to mark things that are true spoilers and things that are mild spoilers Mild spoilers are for those people who want to know a little more information before diving in (but I think its more fun to read without knowing those things...hehe) I hope that makes sense! The Characters I connected with Seth from the very beginning. About half of the story is about Seth's experiences after his death and the other half of the story is told in flashbacks to when Seth was still alive. He doesn't have the greatest life while alive and these flashbacks help you to understand Seth better. Mild spoiler --> Seth is gay and this book is partly a coming out story. We follow Seth as he falls in love and see what happens when his friends and family find out. I haven't read from the POV of many gay characters, so I loved that! I'm glad to see this book add diversity to my reading. True spoiler --> I was NOT expecting the appearance of more characters! My jaw dropped when we discover there are others in this after-death world. It added a whole new twist to the book. Were they real? Were they imagined? I had no idea! I did feel that the young boy was a little wise beyond his years (which made me question if he was real!) but it didn't really bother me much. Seth's family life and relationship with his parents is complex - there is some heavy stuff in here! This book made me feel genuine feelings for Seth and what he went through. True spoiler --> I absolutely hated Seth's parents - mostly his mom, but his dad enabled his mother, and I blame him for that. What terrible people! But then again, some part of me wonders if subconsciously I would feel the same way if the situation had happened to me. Would I be able to forgive completely, or would I on some level always blame my son for what happened? The Story and Plot This is the type of story where the reader is kept guessing constantly throughout the book. Although I typically HATE not knowing what is going on (especially by the time I'm more than 100 pages or so in), I actually enjoyed the guessing game in this book. I think it's because the main character also doesn't know what is going on and you, as the reader, get to experience exactly what he is experiencing, as he experiences it. The whole idea behind this book is so interesting to me - it's the first of it's kind that I've read. I'll admit there are similarly themed books out there - I've just never read any of them. Mild spoiler --> I wasn't expecting this book to be a dystopian story, but it is! Although this isn't technically a spoiler, I enjoyed being surprised by this aspect of the story. True spoiler --> I was NOT expecting a virtual world to be what was going on here. That was a big surprise for me! I know there are other books out there where people live in a virtual world (Ready Player One comes to mind) but I haven't read any yet. One tiny complaint I have is that the book has one of those ""open to interpretation"" endings that I have recently mentioned I don't love. I almost loved this one though - and Patrick Ness can make it up to me by writing a sequel *wink wink*. But seriously - I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS!! WHAT DOES IT MEAN? In Summary This book is about some tough stuff guys (trigger warnings --> This book explores suicide and emotional abuse. ) and it makes you ask yourself some hard questions about life. Just like in the Chaos Walking trilogy, this book isn't just a story - it's so much more! It makes you think and ask questions about life, death, and morality... and I don't know what else. Stuff! This book is very thought provoking and I enjoyed every second of it. I think I'm gushing now.

404,"This book was crazy. Micah is a pathological liar who is dealing with her boyfriend's sudden death. The book is divided into three parts, Part One: Telling the Truth, Part Two: Telling the True Truth and Part Three: The Actual Real Truth . It's a big guessing game from start to finish. The book goes back and forth, before Zach's death and after, as well as short glimpses into Micah's early childhood. After reading about her childhood, her family history, her personal 'truth', and all of her inner fears, doubts, and feelings of loneliness, I still didn't feel like I truly knew Micah. And the reason for that is simple: I can't trust her. This lack of trust is not a coincidence. It's clear that the author meant for it to be that way. That's what the book is about. Micah has lied for what seems like forever, and she's finally ready to tell you the truth. Will you believe her? Even after unraveling the mystery and navigating the crazy twist (I avoided spoilers to I could really enjoy the story, and it was definitely an interesting twist), I still felt a disconnect. Not only did I feel like I didn't get a chance to truly know Micah, but I also didn't get a good feel of her parents or Zach. Just bits and pieces of them. The same goes for all the minor characters in this story. I don't know if this was done on purpose or what. The book is written in such a way that events are clouded in mystery and all you're left with is random fragments that you later have to fit together to make sense of what's really happened. There were some things I didn't doubt or question in the story. Micah's love for Zach, for example. Or her feelings of loneliness. But I can't ignore what I do doubt: Is the Actual Real Truth the truth? Can I believe? I felt the foundation of the book crumbled for me towards the end, after everything was revealed, and it affected the way I felt about this story as a whole. Once I finished the book, I was left with questions that will never get answered: Why were we introduced to Micah's brother Jordan when we never find out what big accident caused his death? Why were her parents so affected by it? Why is Pete practically absolved of all guilt after his role in Zach's death? The lack of answers is disappointing and left me dissatisfied. While I appreciate that Larbalestier attempted something different and introduced a unique narrator, the twist and the overall plot was overshadowed by skepticism and wariness on my part.",2,young_adult,"['book', 'crazy', 'micah', 'pathological', 'liar', 'deal', 'boyfriend', 'sudden', 'death', 'book', 'divide', 'part', 'tell', 'truth', 'tell', 'true', 'truth', 'actual', 'real', 'truth', 'big', 'guessing', 'game', 'start', 'finish', 'book', 'go', 'forth', 'zach', 'death', 'short', 'glimpse', 'micah', 'early', 'childhood', 'read', 'childhood', 'family', 'history', 'personal', 'truth', 'inner', 'fear', 'doubt', 'feeling', 'loneliness', 'feel', 'like', 'truly', 'know', 'micah', 'reason', 'simple', 'trust', 'lack', 'trust', 'coincidence', 'clear', 'author', 'mean', 'way', 'book', 'micah', 'lie', 'like', 'forever', 'finally', 'ready', 'tell', 'truth', 'believe', 'unravel', 'mystery', 'navigate', 'crazy', 'twist', 'avoid', 'spoiler', 'enjoy', 'story', 'definitely', 'interesting', 'twist', 'feel', 'disconnect', 'feel', 'like', 'chance', 'truly', 'know', 'micah', 'good', 'feel', 'parent', 'zach', 'bit', 'piece', 'go', 'minor_character', 'story', 'know', 'purpose', 'book', 'write', 'way', 'event', 'cloud', 'mystery', 'leave', 'random', 'fragment', 'later', 'fit', 'sense', 'happen', 'thing', 'doubt', 'question', 'story', 'micah', 'love', 'zach', 'example', 'feeling', 'loneliness', 'ignore', 'doubt', 'actual', 'real', 'truth', 'truth', 'believe', 'feel', 'foundation', 'book', 'crumble', 'end', 'reveal', 'affect', 'way', 'feel', 'story', 'finish', 'book', 'leave', 'question', 'answer', 'introduce', 'micah', 'brother', 'jordan', 'find', 'big', 'accident', 'cause', 'death', 'parent', 'affect', 'pete', 'practically', 'absolve', 'guilt', 'role', 'zach', 'death', 'lack', 'answer', 'disappointing', 'leave', 'dissatisfied', 'appreciate', 'larbalestier', 'attempt', 'different', 'introduce', 'unique', 'narrator', 'twist', 'overall', 'plot', 'overshadow', 'skepticism', 'wariness']"
405,"Simon's a junior in a suburban Atlanta high school, he's gay and he's in the closet. He's playing the only boy pickpocket in ""Oliver."" He's e-mailing another gay kid from his school, and he's falling in love with him, but he doesn't know who he is. Meanwhile, there's a kid blackmailing him -- the kid playing Fagin. Then the blackmailer ups the stakes and puts on a public school forum that Simon is gay. And Simon tells no one. What the kid did besides being awful, is sufficient to send him to jail for a long time in many states. Simon's parents, sisters, his drama teacher and friends are great and overwhelmingly supportive, but he told none of them about his cast mate. Maybe it's realistic, but as a sometimes teacher, director, as an adult who cares about this fictional character, I wish he told someone. Maybe the kid playing Fagin needed help, that he didn't get because Simon didn't speak up. There's a charming love story here about good, nice kids getting together. I liked this book a lot, but the antagonist's actions -- and the protagonist's-- are why it's not a 5 star book for me, though I certainly understand why so many people gave it more stars.

406,"Ahhh Percy Jackson, how I've missed you. Having read the first series so long ago, I knew exactly how Percy felt trying to get his memories back. I loved Frank and Hazel and all the new characters, as well as the old ones that resurfaced. Nico has always been fascinating, so glad to see him again. But poor Percy, the kid can't catch a break. I hope he gets some peace with Annabeth one day (although rather unlikely in the world). Percy himself thinks about that a lot in this story. But it will be a long road ahead... I can't wait to see what happens when all seven demigods get together. There are so many personalities that I'm going to need a chart to remember them all! I am amazed by Rick Riordan's research. Not only is he dealing with Greek gods, he has Roman ones going as well and there are so many myths it's incredible. Questions for next book: How will Hazel loose her curse? How/did Sammy turn into Leo (I read The Lost Hero, but I don't remember if there was anything weird about when he lived before camp)? Will there be a Frank/Hazel/Leo love triangle? What's this new prophecy about Annabeth? How will she cause problems (I hope she and Percy stay together! What will happen when Percy meets Jason? Will there be a Reyna/Jason/Piper fight/triangle? That 'an oath to keep on final breath' part is making me nervous... What is this big sacrifice that Percy isn't going to be able to make - so Frank will have to make it for him?

407,"Well, I finished the series. I'm glad I read it all. I had a few issues with MockingJay - though I do feel it wrapped up the trilogy well. This book had the biggest kick in the teeth for me when Prim dies at the end. I cried for a solid 10 minutes. Finnick, Boggs - I was prepared to lose all of them, but not Prim. Everything after that kind of didn't really matter. I'm glad she ends up with Peeta and I find their relationship very plausible. But there is so much lost at the end. Overall, I felt that for most of the book Katniss was just wandering around clueless a little too much. I would have expected her to take a more active interest in what was happening. I know she was a pawn in all this, but I did expect her to figure out a bit more and have someone to talk to about it.",3,young_adult,"['finish', 'series', 'glad', 'read', 'issue', 'mockingjay', 'feel', 'wrap', 'trilogy', 'book', 'big', 'kick', 'tooth', 'prim', 'die', 'end', 'cry', 'solid', 'minute', 'finnick', 'boggs', 'prepared', 'lose', 'prim', 'kind', 'matter', 'glad', 'end', 'peeta', 'find', 'relationship', 'plausible', 'lose', 'end', 'overall', 'feel', 'book', 'katniss', 'wander', 'clueless', 'little', 'expect', 'active', 'interest', 'happen', 'know', 'pawn', 'expect', 'figure', 'bit', 'talk']"
408,"4.5 stars ""Everything happens for a reason. People say these things to make sense of the world. Secretly, in their hearts, almost everyone believes that there's some meaning, some willfulness to life. Fairness. Basic decency. Good things happen to good people. Bad things only happen to bad people. No one wants to believe that life is random. I am a realist. It's better to see life as it is, not as you wish it to be. Things don't happen for a reason. They just happen."" I wasn't expecting to love this book as much as I did. This book was like a breath of fresh air. This book inspires me so much and I absolutely love Nicola Yoon's writing style. I read Everything, Everything last year and I wasn't a huge fan of it, I thought it was just okay. But this book is easily a new all time favorite of mine. This book follows a Jamacian girl named Natasha whose family is getting deported in twelve hours. She wants to be a scientist and she doesn't believe in love or God or anything really except or sceince. I really like Natasha's character because she's so strong and she's such a realist and she is desperate to have a future in America. On the day her and her family are being deported she meets Daniel, a Korean-American boy who is a hopeless romantic and a poet and he's rebelling against his family's wishes for him to become a doctor. I love Daniel's character because he's so optomistic and he believe sin love at first sight and he doesn't really know what he wants to do with his life at the age of seventeen years old. I really appreciate the diversity in this book. I've never read a book like this before, a person of color and a korean. I just love seeing diverse books like this in YA because there isn't nearly enough of it. This book reminds me a lot of Eleanor & Park, not only because Daniel is asian just like Park, but because of the way the chapters are written from both characters perspectives and the chapters are short and sweet. It also reminds me of November 9 with the way it follows a couple who meets and falls in love on the same day. The one down side of this book is that it has some serious insta-love. I usually roll my eyes at insta-love but this one was just written so well I honestly believed it myself, which is crazy for me because I hate insta love 99% of the time. I love how Daniel believes in love at first sight and how he tries to use sceince to prove that love at first sight exists. I love one of their first converstaions in the cafe when Natasha says love doesn't exist. It reminds me of that scene in 500 Days of Summer when he tells her love isn't like Santa Clause, love exists whether we want to believe in it or not. I love the way the romance is written, it's so passionate and beautiful and it never feels forced. With beautiful quotes like this: ""Touching him is order and chaos, like being assembled and disassembled at the same time."" I also love how well-devloped their families are, and each member of their families have fleshed-out, interesting back stories. I especially enjoyed the back story with Natasha's Dad and his dream of becoming an actor and how their whole family suffered because of his unwillingness to let go of that dream. I also loved seeing the relationship with Daniel and his older brother Charlie who is a complete douche bag, and Daniel's Father who desperately wants him to become a doctor and be successful in life. His father is protective of him and doesn't want Daniel to grow up poor like he did. I love getting to read from the perspective of two families who moved to America to start a new life, and the struggle of never truly feeling accepeted in a new country. Daniel talks about how his parents want him to act more Korean but everyone else expects him to act ""more American"". It's such an interetsing perspective. This book brings up a lot of things I think about a lot. Daniel doesn't know what he wants to do with his life and he questions why should we know what we want to do with the rest of our lives at seventeen years old? I completely agree and relate to this, as I felt the same way at seventeen. It also talks about fate and coincidence and whether or not things happen for a reason or if things just happen. I like this quote: ""Life is just a series of dumb decisions and indecisions and coincidences that we choose to ascribe meaning to."" In a way I think that is true. Maybe things don't happen for a reason maybe things just happen and that's life. I also liked getting chapters form random characters that would appear throughout the book. Like Irene, a security guard at the building Natasha is going to. It's so increidbly random and at first I didn't like it, getting random chapters from the perspectves of ranodm characters - but some of the short stories were so interesting and heart breaking. I like the idea that every single person around us is living a life as complex and vivid as ours. I'm a curious person and I always wonder about other strangers lives, so to actually get little glimpses of the strangers in Natasha and Daniel's lives is really interetsing. I love that Irene's character is who brought them together in the end. Natasha saved Irene's life years ago in New York, and now in a way it's like Irene is saving Natasha's life, by bringing her and Daniel back together. It's such a beautful full circle. I also loved the side story with the lawyer leaving his wife for his paralegal. I loved how Hannah, his paralegal talked about how she wanted to be like a fairytale and then her final chapter was: they all lived happily ever after. I also love that scene where Daniel and Natasha both see a flash mob on the subway and as a reader you are hoping they see ecah other, but they pass right by each other. I also love their first kiss scene when they are singing kareoke. That is one of the most passionate first kiss scenes I've ever read in a book and I enjoyed it a lot. I felt so bad for Natasha's family at the end when they did end up getting deported. I thought the pacing of the last two chapters was weird, considering almost the entire book took place in one day and then those last chapters skipped ahead by five years or so? And then THAT ENDING. I almost threw the book across the room. How could it just end there? I was so shook. It was beautiful but tragic at the same time. Overall, I'm very impressed with this story. I'm still shook by that ending, and I can't even believe it ended like that. I really love this story and I will read anything Nicola Yoon writes. Knowing this story is personal to her because she is a woman of color who is married to a korean makes it even better. We need more diverse books like this in YA (and in general). I just really like books that make me think about life and force me to consider things I never thought about before. I will be thinking about this book long after I finish reading it. This book is just insanely beautiful and I recommend it to everyone.",5,young_adult,"['star', 'happen', 'reason', 'people', 'thing', 'sense', 'world', 'secretly', 'heart', 'believe', 'meaning',

409,"When I was 13, my uncle killed himself. We'd known for a long time how sick he was, but barely in my teens myself I didn't understand the full consequences of his actions till several years later. The reason behind my bringing this up is if time travel was possible, as it is in All Our Yesterdays, I could conceivably see my aunt going back to make her husband take his medication, to not leave her and their two beautiful children alone. Only what would doing that do to the future? Would it alter my cousins' fierce motivation to be the best at school just to ease my aunt's burden? Terrill provides a different yet clear approach to travelling through time/the possible paradoxes created from time travel. For a YA sci-fi centered around a romance, the book doesn't cut any corners. I'd hesitate to classify it a dystopian, given that future events in half the book haven't exactly happened (yup, I spent a fair amount of time getting my mind blown), but the world Em and Finn live in is certainly drastically altered from Marina's and Finn's. The pacing was right on the money, the relationships between Em/Marina, James and Finn both tragic and lovely. It also made me think about how I'd react facing my future self... probably freak the fuck out. JAMES, POOR BABY. :'( There's something to be said about such a solid debut novel.

410,"Official Rating: 5 Thoughts: I mean, there's no way to be subtle about this. This book fucked me up, in the best way possible. Normally when I write reviews, I have specific things that I want to talk about, but I only finished this monster literally five minutes ago, so coherent thoughts I do not have. I've read a couple of not-so-kind reviews from other people, who were a little dissatisfied with the ending and how it's very fairytale, happy-ending-y . Personally I thought it worked very well - appropriate tension had been introduced at appropriate times, but resulted in a satisfying enough conclusion in regards to gratuitous character and emotional payoff that I'm left bursting to read the sequel to see what happens next, and not caught up in heartbreak. I think one of the reasons why I adored this book so much from the get-go was not only the fact that its epistolary format kept things dynamic and fast-paced, but also how much it spoke my language. See, I've put a LOT of hours, and a LOT of money into understanding tech-speak. Literally, I'm doing a degree in it. So when I opened this novel and, for the first time in my entire life, saw actually complicated and (Lord help me) accurate tech-speak, my ego gained about fifty kilos. Beyond my own narcissistic tendencies, however, it showed just how much research and time had been dedicated to getting these details right. The inclusion of binary code, of programming lines, of the concept of executing and debugging programs before they actually make sense and do what they're supposed to - THESE are the tiny details which so many sci-fi and technology-based books so often leave out. And the best way to make something so inherently inhuman seem organic? Add in these details. Don't make it seem like technology is all wizz-bang wonders and miracles, and once you've got the skills, you can do it all perfectly first-go. I'm gonna try to make this review a little more coherent now; because holy cow we gotta talk about those characters, man. Look, I'm not going to lie, when I first read what Illuminae was about, and how it was structured, I was very concerned as to how Kaufman and Kristoff were going to craft characters that we as readers would not only relate to, but somehow become attached to - and I honestly don't think it could have been done better. These characters felt real. They were interesting, and they felt different. Kady was flawed - she was abrasive, and insubordinate, and cold, and arrogant, and damaged. But she adapted to her situation in a way which felt so very, very human to me. Her lack of connection to the fleet gave her a perspective which enabled her to ask those questions which rippled into the Illuminae files. Her part in, and emotional and psychological reaction to every breath-stealing event in Illuminae felt genuine, and felt real. Ezra was delightful - I wish we'd gotten a bit more of his 'perspective' (as much as is possible in an epistolary novel), because I feel like there was a lot of untapped potential there. But at the same time, I'm glad that some parts of him remain a mystery - not just so that there's room for further exploration in the later books, but also because that makes him seem even more like Kady's person. His character didn't belong to us, the readers - he was a person who was Kady's to love, and to loathe, and to grieve, and to rediscover . It added a very human element to the text, and had the bonus effect of helping to add to the somewhat mysterious element of the documents. Byron was just. sob. Incredible. Keep it up, buddy, you're doing a great job. AIDAN was on a whole other level - a point at which I'm no longer talking about how phenomenal the characters were, and talking about how mind-blowing-ly amazing the themes were. I don't think I've ever read a novel which has forced me to confront the concept of humanity and morality and understanding and perception and creation and every other philosophy-questioning topic as intensely, and as gloriously as this before. By the end, I was crying. As in, there were actual tears. Because of course AIDAN would come to consider these higher-level things. If you create artificial intelligence, and you put it among living, breathing creatures and give it a job - no matter what kind of restrictions you place on it, eventually it's going to ask the questions that human kind has been asking since day one: who am I, what am I, why am I? The evolution of AIDAN was one of my favourite things about Illuminae. Besides it being one of the best representations of an AI in general that I've ever read, its progression from mindless, order-following AI, to pre-teen temper tantrum AI, to thinks-it's-a-deity AI, to self-questioning AI, to the final product was so deliciously organic that I honestly don't have the words to describe how much I loved it. And the final product - a creation which was somewhere between human and artificial, somewhere between being and not being, somewhere between a rock and a hard place, made it the number one thing that I loved the most about Illuminae. Overall, my feelings for this book could be summarised by the fact that by the end, I was feeling so many wonderful and horrible things that I was completely crying, but so absorbed by the break-neck pace and wonderfully, gorgeously juxtaposing moments of silence that, despite literally not being able to read the page sometimes thanks to those wonderful tears, I kept fucking reading. This book was one of those phenomenal, gorgeously intricate novels in which the language on the page made my head spin and my heart pound and my ears rush and my fingers twitch and my hands cramp and my breath quicken and my eyes spill and so many other fantastically, fantastically human things. Illuminae's words were its own soundtrack, its own music. I was so, so happy to sing along. Read this book.

411,"Okay, I have a lot of mixed feelings on this book. I think that there were both good and bad parts of this book, and I feel like everything that I liked, I also didn't like. I'm not sure if that makes perfect sense. Basically, I liked the characters--they were fairly interesting to read about and fairly different from one another--but at the same time, they felt very typical of this type of book; the brooding boy who'd suffered, and was artistic and different than everyone else, and the tragic girl who had been through a lot and didn't know how to deal with it. This strange juxtaposition is something that flowed throughout the whole book for me. The plot felt the same way; on the whole, engaging, but at the same time nothing particularly fresh or original; it almost feels like a rewritten draft of a John Green book. Essentially, it wasn't boring to read, but I was invigorated by the freshness of the plot. Again, for the writing--the writing wasn't bad, but it was a bit grandiose in the way that writing in contemporary love stories between two troubled teens tends to be. To reiterate, I didn't dislike the writing, it just had those traces of inflated importance that I feel like plague a lot of books similar to this. The last thing I'm going to comment on about this book is the mental illness part of it. This was one of the main reasons I read the book--mental illness is something I've dealt with for me whole life, and many people around me are in a constant battle with, so I'm infinitely searching for good representation in mainstream books. While I can say that in All the Bright Places, mental illness was definitely represented, I couldn't personally relate to it despite also having depression and anxiety disorders. NOW, that's not to say it is a bad thing--everyone experiences their mental illness in different ways, and that's perfectly fine. The only bit of the mental illness portrayal that I'm still wondering about is if it's glorified. I don't think it's overtly glorified and I actually did feel like the suicide was treated well, and Violet's reaction of anger and sadness is fine  but I do feel like because of the grandiose nature of the story, it makes the suicide and mental health seem somewhat attractive, which I didn't love. That sentiment might not make perfect sense, because I'm still really unsure on whether or not I feel like it's glorified, because in certain ways I think it is, in other ways I think it's not. But essentially, I liked this book, but I didn't love it. It was, as a whole, what I'd expect from this genre, and from the description.",3,young_adult,"['okay', 'lot', 'mixed_feeling', 'book', 'think', 'good', 'bad', 'part', 'book', 'feel', 'like', 'like', 'like', 'sure', 'make', 'perfect', 'sense', 'basically', 'like', 'character', 'fairly', 'interesting', 'read', 'fairly', 'different', 'time', 'feel', 'typical', 'type', 'book', 'brooding', 'boy', 'suffer', 'artistic', 'different', 'tragic', 'girl', 'lot', 'know', 'deal', 'strange', 'juxtaposition', 'flow', 'book', 'plot', 'feel', 'way', 'engage', 'time', 'particularly', 'fresh', 'original', 'feel', 'like', 'rewrite', 'draft', 'john_green', 'book', 'essentially', 'boring', 'read', 'invigorate', 'freshness', 'plot', 'writing', 'writing', 'bad', 'bit', 'grandiose', 'way', 'write', 'contemporary', 'love', 'story', 'troubled', 'teen', 'tend', 'reiterate', 'dislike', 'writing', 'trace', 'inflated', 'importance', 'feel', 'like', 'plague', 'lot', 'book', 'similar', 'thing', 'go', 'comment', 'book', 'mental_illness', 'main', 'reason', 'read', 'book', 'mental_illness', 'deal', 'life', 'people', 'constant', 'battle', 'infinitely', 'search', 'good', 'representation', 'mainstream', 'book', 'bright', 'places', 'mental_illness', 'definitely', 'represent', 'personally', 'relate', 'despite', 'have', 'depression', 'anxiety', 'disorder', 'bad', 'thing', 'experience', 'mental_illness', 'different', 'way', 'perfectly', 'fine', 'bit', 'mental_illness', 'portrayal', 'wonder', 'glorify', 'think', 'overtly', 'glorify', 'actually', 'feel', 'like', 'suicide', 'treat', 'violet', 'reaction', 'anger', 'sadness', 'fine', 'feel', 'like', 'grandiose', 'nature', 'story', 'make', 'suicide', 'mental_health', 'somewhat', 'attractive', 'love', 'sentiment', 'perfect', 'sense', 'unsure', 'feel', 'like', 'glorify', 'certain', 'way', 'think', 'way', 'think', 'essentially', 'like', 'book', 'love', 'expect', 'genre', 'description']"

413,"August 2- Even though I've heard that this was the worst book out of the trilogy, I felt like it was the best. Of course, I hated The Hunger Games, but loved the movie.

415,"The Way We Fall was a very solid addition to the bloated young adult apocalypse/dystopia genre. The Lives We Lost demonstrated why the fate of the world should never be left in the hands of teenagers (they're nothing but angst and love triangles and poor foresight). The Worlds We Make is the conclusion and has all the same flaws as the second book. I do give a lot of kudos for the covers and the titles of all three books. They are all very lovely and intriguing. Kaelyn and the gang are still on the run from the (evil?) Wardens, who are trying to capture the vaccine for the friendly flu that Kaelyn's father created. Kaelyn is desperate to get the vaccine to the CDC so it can be given to all of humanity. Like in book 2, there's lots of roadtripping, Kaelyn feeling angsty/guilty, and romantic entanglements. The highlight of this book was Kaelyn's conversation with Michael, the supposed Big Bad of the series and the leader of the Wardens. Michael is more of an anti-hero than a true villain. He has consolidated power in his effort to save humanity. The world needs leadership, and he's going to give it, by the gun if necessary. He's not a bad guy, just a guy in desperate circumstances trying to hold things together. I liked this characterization, and kudos to Crewe for not just making the Big Bad evil. Kaelyn's contact with the CDC is more frustrating. The CDC doctor decides, against all better judgment and the Hippocratic Oath, to withhold the vaccine from anyone she deems unworthy. Because that makes sense. When the world has been destroyed, you want to make sure that there is MORE chaos and violence by withholding a necessity from terrified, dying people. As this is obviously a stupid plan, Kaelyn & co. disagree. And actually figure out a solution so that everyone can get the vaccine. Huzzah! So happy endings all around, except for the fact that society is in shambles and there's no getting it back. I predict Michael will continue to be the warlord the Americas need (because even if everyone can get the vaccine, Michael still controls other resources, like food and medicine). But at least Kaelyn can go back and live on her island with Leo, especially since Gav is conveniently dead so she doesn't have to make any difficult decisions about who she should make out with.",2,young_adult,"['way', 'fall', 'solid', 'addition', 'bloated', 'young_adult', 'apocalypse', 'dystopia', 'genre', 'life', 'lose', 'demonstrate', 'fate', 'world', 'leave', 'hand', 'teenager', 'angst', 'love_triangle', 'poor', 'foresight', 'world', 'conclusion', 'flaw', 'second', 'book', 'lot', 'kudo', 'cover', 'title', 'book', 'lovely', 'intriguing', 'kaelyn', 'gang', 'run', 'evil', 'wardens', 'try', 'capture', 'vaccine', 'friendly', 'flu', 'kaelyn', 'father', 'create', 'kaelyn', 'desperate', 'vaccine', 'cdc', 'give', 'humanity', 'like', 'book', 'lot', 'roadtripping', 'kaelyn', 'feel', 'angsty', 'guilty', 'romantic', 'entanglement', 'highlight', 'book', 'kaelyn', 'conversation', 'michael', 'supposed', 'big', 'bad', 'series', 'leader', 'wardens', 'michael', 'anti', 'hero', 'true', 'villain', 'consolidate', 'power', 'effort', 'save', 'humanity', 'world', 'need', 'leadership', 'go', 'gun', 'necessary', 'bad_guy', 'guy', 'desperate', 'circumstance', 'try', 'hold', 'thing', 'like', 'characterization', 'kudo', 'crewe', 'make', 'big', 'bad', 'evil', 'kaelyn', 'contact', 'cdc', 'frustrating', 'cdc', 'doctor', 'decide', 'well', 'judgment', 'hippocratic', 'oath', 'withhold', 'vaccine', 'deem', 'unworthy', 'make_sense', 'world', 'destroy', 'want', 'sure', 'chaos', 'violence', 'withhold', 'necessity', 'terrified', 'die', 'people', 'obviously', 'stupid', 'plan', 'kaelyn', 'disagree', 'actually', 'figure', 'solution', 'vaccine', 'huzzah', 'happy_ending', 'fact', 'society', 'shamble', 'get', 'predict', 'michael', 'continue', 'warlord', 'americas', 'need', 'vaccine', 'michael', 'control', 'resource', 'like', 'food', 'medicine', 'kaelyn', 'live', 'island', 'leo', 'especially', 'gav', 'conveniently', 'dead', 'difficult', 'decision']"

417,"So I decided to rewrite me review to restate how much I hate this book and why is deserves a spot on my 'ugh' shelf. Now as I said in my original review I only got 1/4 through this book. I thought I could get through this in like two days, maybe three. I mean I was going to be in a motel with slow internet so I might as well get a lot of reading done. Thank god I didn't bring it with me because I hated it before I left the house and opted for Something Like Spring (which turned out to be my favourite as of far in its respective series so that was lucky). But no, this book isn't about a gay character that exists outside of its gayness (though very likeable) like the book I decided to bring instead. I'm coming from this from two perspective, a perspective as not only a lesbian but a feminist. I'll get on why the feminist part matters in a moment. As from the point of view as an actual lgbt person, Ryan Dean could not shut up about how gay the one gay character is (hey authors, please write in gay characters for no reason, we are not plot devices). Literally, every second he appeared Ryan Dean reminded us that this guy is in fact  gay and how  find and dandy that is to him . You know, despite feeling uncomfortable he was alone in a room with him. He pointed it out at the most  unnecessary times, like giving him a high five and calling it the 'best gay-straight high five ever'. Not only that, he made sure to tell us how much of an upstanding heterosexual he was. And that brings in my perspective as a feminist. He made sure to tell us how goddamn hot  every girl he knows is (except for the woman downstairs who is probably a witch). His crush on his best friend was so superficial, I may have only seen a bit of her character but she didn't seem to have anything to her. And since this is from Ryan Dean's perspective, this would mean he only likes her for her looks. I felt like I knew nothing about her. Over all, he just objectified women and it made me so uncomfortable. Oh, and the fact he got so upset she called him 'little boy'. That was irritating and is really why I don't like reading characters under the age of 16. They have this problem, where you can tell how young they are and are just so irritating (there are exceptions obviously but this was a real drawback for this book). I had heard it had a shocking ending and I guessed it and I was so mad that the only gay character was used as a plot device. He seemed to only have the purpose to die and it is so irritating.

418,"Going between 4 and 5 stars for this one which is a bit strange because if something is amazing for me, well, it is amazing and that is that. I did read this book during a really depressing point in my life-- right after my grandma died who I was really close to-- and it managed to make me laugh, so I am immensely grateful for that, so that is what is giving it 5 stars right now. Just that really personal reason. What about the story is it that would cause it to lack a star? I guess because I expected it to be a little more nerdy than it actually was, first of all. The main character, Cath, is nerdy in that she writes fanfiction for her favorite book series growing up, Simon Snow, which is basically very similar to Harry Potter. She is more introverted and socially awkward than her twin sister, Wren. I relate to loving a book series (Harry Potter), and I am introverted and socially awkward, but I also am a fangirl for several other things. Cath just likes one series while I like a lot more as well as being a nerdy fangirl for TV shows and movie other than Harry Potter. Yes, Cath is a fangirl but not quite in the same way I am. I am more into other sci-fi and fantasy things, and I think that makes me more nerdy. I would've liked it a little more if Cath was just that much more like I am, but overall it isn't a huge deal. I think Cath was written into one fandom to keep it simpler as well as relatable to more readers. Secondly, I don't think an important plot point was fully addressed. There was almost a complete and final confrontation with Cath's and Wren's mother at the hospital, but the mother just runs away and Cath doesn't bother after that. Later, Cath, when talking to her writing professor about the story that she did not write at all yet, freaks out and says it is about her mother. I thought oh okay, we will get a little more resolution from her short story which will somehow reflect her mother, but then her short story ends up being about Wren (though we don't get to read much of it, but the little we do is clearly about Wren.) The whole mom issue is almost resolved when Wren says that she is just on speaking terms with their mom (who she calls Laura and not mom) but their mom doesn't want any sort of motherly relationship. Cath should be hearing this from the mom and not her sister. It just left me unsatisfied. I didn't mean to start it off with my complaints, I did like this book. It made me laugh (as I said) and the love interest is adorable. Though my boyfriend is very different than the love interest in many ways in others I totally can see him do some of the things that the love interest did. I don't read much contemporary, but this is definitely a favorite contemporary since I can relate so much between the fangirling, social awkwardness, and nice love interest, and that is probably the case for several other readers of this book (since fangirls probably have these qualities). The book also deals with several mental health issues very nicely which was unexpected from the plot. I want to say more nice things about this book to equal out my complaints, but really that sums it up quite nicely. Anything that is funny and relatable to me is always a good book. I am sticking with 5 stars.",5,young_adult,"['go', 'star', 'bit', 'strange', 'amazing', 'amazing', 'read', 'book', 'depressing', 'point', 'right', 'grandma', 'die', 'close', 'manage', 'laugh', 'immensely', 'grateful', 'give_star', 'right', 'personal', 'reason', 'story', 'cause', 'lack', 'star', 'guess', 'expect', 'little', 'nerdy', 'actually', 'main_character', 'cath', 'nerdy', 'write', 'fanfiction', 'favorite', 'book', 'series', 'grow', 'simon', 'snow', 'basically', 'similar', 'harry_potter', 'introverted', 'socially', 'awkward', 'twin', 'sister', 'wren', 'relate', 'love', 'book', 'series', 'harry_potter', 'introverted', 'socially', 'awkward', 'fangirl', 'thing', 'cath', 'like', 'series', 'like', 'lot', 'nerdy', 'fangirl', 'tv', 'show', 'movie', 'harry_potter', 'yes', 'cath', 'fangirl', 'way', 'sci_fi', 'fantasy', 'thing', 'think', 'make', 'nerdy', 'like', 'little', 'cath', 'like', 'overall', 'huge', 'deal', 'think', 'cath', 'write', 'fandom', 'simple', 'relatable', 'reader', 'secondly', 'think', 'important', 'plot', 'point', 'fully', 'address', 'complete', 'final', 'confrontation', 'cath', 'wren', 'mother', 'hospital', 'mother', 'run_away', 'cath', 'bother', 'later', 'cath', 'talk', 'writing', 'professor', 'story', 'write', 'freak', 'say', 'mother', 'think', 'oh', 'okay', 'little', 'resolution', 'short_story', 'reflect', 'mother', 'short_story', 'end', 'wren', 'read', 'little', 'clearly', 'wren', 'mom', 'issue', 'resolve', 'wren', 'say', 'speak', 'term', 'mom', 'call', 'laura', 'mom', 'mom', 'want', 'sort', 'motherly', 'relationship', 'cath', 'hear', 'mom', 'sister', 'leave', 'unsatisfied', 'mean', 'start', 'complaint', 'like', 'book', 'laugh', 'say', 'love_interest', 'adorable', 'boyfriend', 'different', 'love_interest', 'way', 'totally', 'thing', 'love_interest', 'read', 'contemporary', 'definitely', 'favorite', 'contemporary', 'relate', 'fangirling', 'social', 'awkwardness', 'nice', 'love_interest', 'probably', 'case', 'reader', 'book', 'fangirl', 'probably', 'quality', 'book', 'deal', 'mental_health', 'issue', 'nicely', 'unexpected', 'plot', 'want', 'nice', 'thing', 'book', 'equal', 'complaint', 'sum', 'nicely', 'funny', 'relatable', 'good', 'book', 'stick', 'star']"

420,"""No one wants to hire an underage, inexperienced, tatted-up Mexican girl. Even McDonald's turned me down."" About : Elena Martinez has slipped through the cracks of California's foster care system. Desperate for money and a future, she signs a contract with the corporate tech giant Aether in exchange for money and a college scholarship: time-travel to the future for 24 hours and bring back info about future technology. The only catch? She can't look into her own future. It might mess with her mind or keep her from returning safely home. If she just gets the technology and gets back through the time portal, she'll be set for life. Elena signs up and, of course, ignores the prohibition on researching her fate. But she doesn't expect to find herself enmeshed in the mystery of a murder: her own. YA science-fiction authored by Elizabeth Briggs and published April 1st 2016 by Aw Teen. Thoughts : Future Shock is perfect for romantic sci-fi junkies, and I flew through it despite a few worldbuilding and research goofs. It starts off a little rough, even helped along by Elena's strong, captivating voice. The problem is Elizabeth Briggs' outdated description of the current foster system in California. To give Elena strong motivations and high stakes for accepting Aether's offer, Briggs puts her in a desperate situation: ""In two months I'll be kicked out of foster care, forced out of my current home, and most likely will have to drop out of school...Once we turn eighteen, they're done. The instant checks stop coming, we'll be out on the street."" Thankfully, I happen to know that this is no longer the case, although it used to be true. My husband works as a juvenile probation officer and he deals every day with kids who've been raised by the CA state system. They do have access to financial and college aid, now, after they reach the age of 18. Elizabeth Briggs is describing the system of a decade ago, in Future Shock. But, hey, this could easily have been set a decade ago, and thankfully the story moves fairly quickly into more plot-relevant terrain. I raced through the story, from here on out, because the pacing never slows and the mystery just gets better and better. After Elena signs on the dotted line, she and four other teens prepare to travel one decade into the future. They will arrive in the future Aether headquarters and have twenty-four hours to gather as much technology as they can. Sounds almost too good to be true...and Elena knows it. She's a street-smart Latina and she asks good questions: Why teenagers? And why foster teenagers, at that? I very rarely found myself ahead of the technical thriller plot. And within the first forty pages, we're in the future! The teenagers are extremely, entertainingly proactive--wandering into shops and exploring the tech--and I love how Briggs imagines the future with lots of cool goodies and sharp edges. Driverless cars rule the road, and they appear to be a government monopoly, as other types of cars were made illegal several years before. Unfortunately, a few notes ring false in this future world, such as the fact that prostitution appears to be legal, but cigarettes are banned. I think a future that legalizes prostitution will likely legalize more drugs instead of criminalizing more, although I could be wrong about that. CA did just make cigarettes illegal under age 21, so perhaps Briggs' future LA is spot on, in this regard. A few other sketchy points jumped out at me. For one thing, a big plot points involves a cure for cancer. It's a nice thought, but I sincerely doubt it's medically feasible that we'll find a generic cure for every kind of cancer. There are too many different kinds . Also, the author has apparently never watched Cops. In several action scenes, her cops seem to lack knowledge of basic police training and strategy. For example, in one instance, the police shoot at teenagers who are running away from them. This would be a major exception to police training, which teaches cops not to shoot at suspects who are running away. In several other instances, these teenagers escape situations in which police could have easily radioed in backup to contain the area. These oversights definitely neutered the action scenes, for me. I was also hoping that Elena's eidetic memory would play a larger role in the book. Considering how the whole first scene is built around her amazing memory, I was expecting more from that angle. Maybe book II will deal with it more. But even when I hit hiccups or areas that could have used further development, I never wanted to stop reading Future Shock. The tech elements are a lot of fun, the pace stays in high gear and the mystery just gets better and better. Every chapter ends with terrific motivations to keep reading. Overall : If you just read fast and don't look too hard at the deets, I guarantee you'll have a good time with Future Shock. I do have high hopes for a high-concept series or trilogy. I loved the premise, the mystery, the Latina narrator, the lightning pace, the imaginative setting of a futuristic LA...I hope this series continues. It's a good thing. I'll probably pick up book II, at some point. Recommended To : This can be a great, fast read for romantic-sci-fi junkies. For someone who has stuck mostly to Fantasy, this YA sci-fi thriller could be something really new and fun. Thanks so much to Elizabeth Briggs, AW Teen and Netgalley for this e-ARC!

421,"Well, I think that this novel is one that I can qualify as having a good idea in principle, but bad in execution. Thirteen Reasons Why is a novel that displays the effects that we all have on different people through the suicide of the main character, Hannah Baker. After her suicide, she proceeds to send out 13 reasons why she did it on cassette tapes, and each person who supposedly caused her to kill herself receives these tapes and they are then supposed to send them on to the next person. So how does this idea work in practice? Well, it has some flaws. First, the good in the story: With the exception of the cassette taps being used, the rest of the book feels timeless. I could read this book ten years from now and it would still sound like how teens talk and act, for the most part (we'll get to that later). Then there is the message. This novel's depiction of how actions have consequences is displayed well, certainly better than other books I've read that try to tackle the same subject. Then there is the confusing portions of this novel. The premise is one that just makes me scratch my head as to how it was to be accomplished. Firstly, we know that Hannah Baker says, early on, that each person must listen to the tapes, and then send them on to the next person to listen to them. If they do not, then a 2nd copy of the tapes will be made very public. My only questions is, how would someone know if they listened to all the tapes? That is briefly mentioned in the novel, but it has too many plot holes to count And considering what happens at the end of the novel, which I won't spoil, I would say it is a good thing that these tapes re released. But that leads me into question number two: if the tapes are released, so what? What is to stop the people named from lying, or spinning what she said? She is not around to be questioned, so how would this be seen as evidence in an open court? I'm no expert on the subject, but it seems like it would have been better had Hannah told someone about what happened to her/seen by her. And that leads me to Hannah herself. Now, before I get into her, let me say that, so far as I know, I have little to no experience with suicide. I do not know anyone who has tried to commit suicide, nor have I tried to do so myself. Killing one's self is never the answer, and if you or anyone you know wants to kill themselves, then you should get help, either by calling the Suicide Prevention hotline, or by talking to someone who can help you. With all that said, the way Hannah is portrayed here, it felt like, with the exceptions of a few 'reasons', I felt that her killing herself seemed an overreaction. Before you grab your pitchforks and torches, let me explain. In another book I've read, Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson, the main character Melinda has something horrible happen to her at a party. She then does not tell anyone what happened to her, and she is then bullied at school because she called the cops on that party and everyone got in trouble as a result. In that book, her attempting suicide is an unwanted, but not a surprising reaction, because, not only can she not escape from the event of what happened to her, but she must also endure the constant bullying at school and her parents unstable marriage at home. Here on the other hand, many of the things Hannah goes through that she lists as reasons seem somewhat trivial by comparison. She and her friend break up, rumors are spread about her at one point, and she gets passed a note that makes a comment about her body that could be considered embarrassing. Things like these make up a majority of the list of reasons. As for the other more extreme reasons, well, these are actually hurtful, and they may cause a person emotional, physical and psychological pain. However, she does almost nothing to tell anyone about what happened to her. With the exception of the very end of the book, she tells no one about what has happened, and even when she does it is in the most vaguest of terms. And she does not even give that confidant a chance to help her. Lastly, regarding Hannah, there is the event of the end of the book, and how it is written from her perspective. I guess that I'll have to tell you what happened for it to make sense, so I'll do so in a spoiler section. Hannah witnesses her ex-best friend Jessica be raped at a party. Jessica herself does not know that it happened because she was passed out at the time. During the sexual assault, Hannah does not do anything to stop it because she is to scared to do so. . After the event detailed above, Hannah is still written like she is the victim that we should be sympathetic towards, even after, so far as we know, she has done nothing to tell the police about what happened. I'm sorry, but this makes me dislike her SO much. I don't know if she was written that way on purpose, but here Hannah comes off a selfish and uncaring. I don't care how many rude notes you get, or how many bad rumors are spread about you. You lose sympathy points with me when you not only don't tell anyone about what you witnessed, but you also still say that the girl listed above is one of the reasons for your suicide. That does not fly with me. In the end, I liked what this novel was trying to do, but many of the reasons to me seemed trivial to me, and I also found major holes in how she was going to spread the tapes of her reasons for her suicide around. Still, as I understand it, I am in the minority. If this book helped you in some way, great, that is excellent and I am glad that you are better off for it. For me however, there was never anything for me to latch on to, and it is for that reason, and those listed above, that I give this book a two out of five. Still, I would consider this a case of 'it's not you it's me"" syndrome. If you think this book might interest you, then by all means, check it out. It just didn't work for me.",2,young_adult,"['think', 'novel', 'qualify', 'have', 'good', 'idea', 'principle', 'bad', 'execution', 'thirteen', 'reasons', 'novel', 'display', 'effect', 'different', 'people', 'suicide', 'main_character', 'hannah', 'baker', 'suicide', 'proceed', 'send', 'reason', 'cassette', 'tape', 'person', 'supposedly', 'cause', 'kill', 'receive', 'tape', 'suppose', 'send', 'person', 'idea', 'work', 'practice', 'flaw', 'good', 'story', 'exception', 'cassette', 'tap', 'rest', 'book', 'feel', 'timeless', 'read', 'book', 'year', 'sound', 'like', 'teen', 'talk', 'act', 'later', 'message', 'novel', 'depiction', 'action', 'consequence', 'display', 'certainly', 'well', 'book', 'read', 'try', 'tackle', 'subject', 'confusing', 'portion', 'novel', 'premise', 'make', 'scratch', 'head', 'accomplish', 'firstly', 'know', 'hannah', 'baker', 'say', 'early', 'person', 'listen', 'tape', 'send', 'person', 'listen', 'copy', 'tape', 'public', 'question', 'know', 'listen', 'tape', 'briefly', 'mention', 'novel', 'plot_hole', 'count', 'consider', 'happen', 'end', 'novel', 'will', 'spoil', 'good', 'thing', 'tape', 'release', 'lead', 'question', 'number', 'tape', 'release', 'stop', 'people', 'name', 'lie', 'spin', 'say', 'question', 'see', 'evidence', 'open', 'court', 'expert', 'subject', 'like', 'well', 'hannah', 'tell', 'happen', 'see', 'lead', 'hannah', 'let', 'far', 'know', 'little', 'experience', 'suicide', 'know', 'try', 'commit_suicide', 'try', 'kill', 'self', 'answer', 'know', 'want', 'kill', 'help', 'call', 'suicide', 'prevention', 'hotline', 'talk', 'help', 'say', 'way', 'hannah', 'portray', 'feel', 'like', 'exception', 'reason', 'feel', 'kill', 'overreaction', 'grab', 'pitchfork', 'torch', 'let', 'explain', 'book', 'read', 'speak', 'laurie', 'halse', 'anderson', 'main_character', 'melinda', 'horrible', 'happen', 'party', 'tell', 'happen', 'bully', 'school', 'call', 'cop', 'party', 'get', 'trouble', 'result', 'book', 'attempt', 'suicide', 'unwanted', 'surprising', 'reaction', 'escape', 'event', 'happen', 'endure', 'constant', 'bullying', 'school', 'parent', 'unstable', 'marriage', 'home', 'hand', 'thing', 'hannah', 'go', 'list', 'reason', 'somewhat', 'trivial', 'comparison', 'friend', 'break', 'rumor', 'spread', 'point', 'gets', 'pass', 'note', 'make', 'comment', 'body', 'consider', 'embarrassing', 'thing', 'like', 'majority', 'list', 'reason', 'extreme', 'reason', 'actually', 'hurtful', 'cause', 'person', 'emotional', 'physical', 'psychological', 'pain', 'tell', 'happen', 'exception', 'end', 'book', 'tell', 'happen', 'vague', 'term', 'confidant', 'chance', 'help', 'lastly', 'hannah', 'event', 'end', 'book', 'write', 'perspective', 'guess', 'tell', 'happen', 'sense', 'spoiler', 'section', 'hannah', 'witness', 'ex', 'best', 'friend', 'jessica', 'rape', 'party', 'jessica', 'know', 'happen', 'pass', 'time', 'sexual_assault', 'hannah', 'stop', 'scared', 'event', 'detail', 'hannah', 'write', 'like', 'victim', 'sympathetic', 'far', 'know', 'tell', 'police', 'happen', 'sorry', 'make', 'dislike', 'know', 'write', 'way', 'purpose', 'hannah', 'come', 'selfish', 'uncaring', 'care', 'rude', 'note', 'bad', 'rumor', 'spread', 'lose', 'sympathy', 'point', 'tell', 'witness', 'girl', 'list', 'reason', 'suicide', 'fly', 'end', 'like', 'novel', 'try', 'reason', 'trivial', 'find', 'major', 'hole', 'go', 'spread', 'tape', 'reason', 'suicide', 'understand', 'minority', 'book', 'help', 'way', 'great', 'excellent', 'glad', 'well', 'latch', 'reason', 'list', 'book', 'consider', 'case', 'syndrome', 'think', 'book', 'interest', 'mean', 'check', 'work']"
422,"I'm struggling with getting my feelings about this on paper. As a child, I loved the Giver. As an adult, I still love the Giver. I feel like it was such an integral part of my growing up, that I can't fully put it into words. I think the reason why it was so important to me was party due to the ambiguous ending, and how it left it up to the reader as to if it was a positive or a negative. That said, I was pleasantly surprised with how much I loved the companion novels, Gathering Blue and Messenger. I will admit, I did see the religious parallels that other reviews have mentioned, and that may have turned me off a bit, but that's my own issue, and it is not overtly done. Well, Matty sacrificing himself at the end of the Messenger for the good of the community was a bit Messiah-esque. Especially considering he died in a crucifixion style pose in the dirt. Gabriel and his angel of God name, vanquishing Evil with compassion. Yeah, I see the allegory. I was excited to see how the stories all matched up in the end, with Gathering Blue seeming the most off topic of the three. I absolutely fell in love with the character Claire. She was lovingly fleshed out in the beginning, and I could easily relate to her - but maybe only because I am an adult; most teens aren't yearning for their children. Returning the story to the original community was a surprise to me- it took me a while to catch on, but it was a throwaway line about the aging ceremonies and how some children were graduating to jackets that buttoned in the front that finally clued me in. I struggled with how everything was wrapped up so neatly at the end, and that seems to be a theme present in a lot of the reviews I've skimmed. I give this four stars for the reason that it serves as a satisfying conclusion. But the part of Lowry's writing that I enjoy is missing. She answers too many questions. She completes the thoughts for us. The reader has little to ask or wonder in the end. Too tidy. As a writer she allows for the questions to linger. I think that's the power in her writing. But it also felt so much like a long awaited reunion. It is a satisfying closure to a long journey. I will say, that out of all the books, the characters that I wanted to read more about were Einar and Claire. Einar... never have I been so in love with a character. My heart hurts thinking of him and his sheep, missing Claire and living out his lonely little life.

423,"Inevitably, this book will be compared to The Fault in Our Stars. Both came out in early 2012 and both are about teens with cancer. However, besides these few similarities, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl and TFIOS are very, very different. While TFIOS is a deep and emotional read, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is hilarious and light. And when I say hilarious, I mean seriously funny. It is a universally acknowledged truth that high school sucks. In fact, high school is where we are introduced to the basic existential question of life: How is it possible to exist in a place that sucks so bad? See what I mean? Greg Gaines, the ""Me"", is fantastic. Not only is he funny as all hell, I could easily see him actually existing somewhere in some high school out in the world, unlike many male characters in YA novels these days, like Augustus Waters. (I still love you, Gus!) He's only out for himself and wants absolutely nothing to do with Rachel and her leukemia. In fact, he mainly only spends time with her to make himself feel better. Rachel, the ""dying girl"", and her leukemia do not actually take center stage. A lot of it is glossed over, and mostly when we see her, she is very quiet. I think the author purposefully didn't let the reader get too attached to Rachel to keep this book lighter and less depressing. In that way, it's very much different from TFIOS. While I wouldn't totally describe this book as ""light and fluffy"", it is very funny and keeps from being your typical depressing cancer books. If you're looking for something lighter and more realistic than TFIOS, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is for you!",4,young_adult,"['inevitably', 'book', 'compare', 'fault', 'stars', 'come', 'early', 'teen', 'cancer', 'similarity', 'earl', 'dying', 'girl', 'tfios', 'different', 'tfios', 'deep', 'emotional', 'read', 'earl', 'dying', 'girl', 'hilarious', 'light', 'hilarious', 'mean', 'seriously', 'funny', 'universally', 'acknowledge', 'truth', 'high_school', 'suck', 'fact', 'high_school', 'introduce', 'basic', 'existential', 'question', 'life', 'possible', 'exist', 'place', 'suck', 'bad', 'mean', 'greg', 'gaines', 'fantastic', 'funny', 'hell', 'easily', 'actually', 'exist', 'high_school', 'world', 'unlike', 'male', 'character', 'ya', 'novel', 'day', 'like', 'augustus', 'waters', 'love', 'gus', 'want', 'absolutely', 'rachel', 'leukemia', 'fact', 'mainly', 'spend_time', 'feel', 'well', 'rachel', 'die', 'girl', 'leukemia', 'actually', 'center', 'stage', 'lot', 'gloss', 'quiet', 'think', 'author', 'purposefully', 'let', 'reader', 'attached', 'rachel', 'book', 'light', 'depressing', 'way', 'different', 'tfios', 'totally', 'describe', 'book', 'light', 'fluffy', 'funny', 'keep', 'typical', 'depressing', 'cancer', 'book', 'look', 'light', 'realistic', 'tfios', 'earl', 'die', 'girl']"
424,"Basically during this whole book I was eying each page and waiting for them to die. plot Honestly?? The middle kind of lagged for me. The writing was great, the characters was great, but the plot wasn't that exciting until the ending. It mainly consisted of Mateo and Rufus walking around the city (and at one point, they go to a restaurant and eat chicken and stuff. BUT WHY DIDN'T THEY EAT EVERYTHING??? THIS I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. IF I HAD ONE DAY TO LIVE I WOULD PIG OUT??????) And while Mateo is pretty much a smol boy who is precious, that doesn't mean I want to read about him crossing the road and everything? characters MY CINNAMON ROLLS. Especially Penny. Or Penny's mom. I FORGOT WHAT HER NAME IS. (I love the mom who Mateo is best friends with!! AHH!! She is great and everything and can we make a spinoff about her please?) MATEO. Ahhhh he is so nice and quiet and he liked staying indoors. (Samee.) He was just so cautious and carefree and I loved his character development. He became more carefree and less cautious as the book went on. He never really felt like he's LIVED his life, but after that day he has experienced love, friendship, jumping off a cliff into water, skydiving (although that was virtual reality) and content. RUFUS. He kind of annoyed me sometimes?? At the beginning of the book, he felt so possessive about Aimee, his ex-girlfriend that it was just... like. no. Aimee had broken up with him, and although Adam's writing let me empathize with him, I didn't understand how he could beat up Peck (Aimee's current boyfriend at the start of the book). He might have KILLED Peck. Killed. Killed. Killed. Excuse me???????????? The character development was GREAT, though. It just.. ahhh. It made Rufus so kind and he started caring for others, and not just doing things for himself. His connection with the smol bean Mateo was so sweet, as was his family- The Plutos. During the book he kept on snapping photos of things and posting them to Instagram and while that's relatable (and useful at the end of the book since Mateo's dad is probably eventually able to learn about what they did but STILLLLL ) WHAT THE HECK ARE YOU DOING, MATEO??? YOU'RE GOING TO DIE AND YOU'RE ON INSTAGRAM?? writing Adam's writing also included some chapters where it showed snippets of others' lives. And honestly I did not enjoy those.

425,"I really, really enjoyed this book, but unfortunately there were a few things that stopped me giving it the full 5 stars. These all somewhat followed the same theme - lack of clarity, and slightly forced writing. Firstly, there was the issue of Dane. It is made very apparent that he is ""bad"" - but more because we are told this, than from being led to really feel this way. There's a reason ""show, not tell"" is so often cited as a rule of good writing! I found his rather sudden, violent attack on Jenna  a surprise, and not a ""wow, that was a significant plot-twist"" sort of a surprise, but more of a ""why exactly did that just happen?"" moment. Also, Jenna's romantic relationship with Ethan  seemed forced, like it was happening because that's what the author wanted to happen, rather than through the characters' actual desires. There was no chemistry between them. However, the story was captivating and thought-provoking enough to keep me hooked, and I would happily read it again. I'll probably read the sequel too, just to see what happens to her dead friends...",4,young_adult,"['enjoy', 'book', 'unfortunately', 'thing', 'stop', 'give_star', 'somewhat', 'follow', 'theme', 'lack', 'clarity', 'slightly', 'forced', 'writing', 'firstly', 'issue', 'dane', 'apparent', 'bad', 'tell', 'lead', 'feel', 'way', 'reason', 'tell', 'cite', 'rule', 'good', 'writing', 'find', 'sudden', 'violent', 'attack', 'jenna', 'surprise', 'wow', 'significant', 'plot_twist', 'sort', 'surprise', 'exactly', 'happen', 'moment', 'jenna', 'romantic_relationship', 'ethan', 'forced', 'like', 'happen', 'author', 'want', 'happen', 'character', 'actual', 'desire', 'chemistry', 'story', 'captivating', 'thought_provoke', 'hooked', 'happily', 'read', 'probably', 'read', 'sequel', 'happen', 'dead', 'friend']"

427,"Loved to read this book, even better than the first installment. First of all I think it's an interesting concept, to introduce after a patriarchic society a matriarchic society, to reveal that both in fact are evil - justice is if men and women are both equal. The injustice of the matriarchic felt even more real and harsh, as you are not used to it. Describe anything you want for a patriarchic society and the reader will believe it in a heartbeat, because in the end this is history and well, the the present too (woops by feminist view came out, sorry). I liked the humor, the plot and the characters. I liked how morally grey everything was. Nothing is more disappointing to me than if the main character is always 'stalwart and true'. Gaia really gets to think about her action, and sometimes none of them seem to be ok. Even though some of the reviewers don't understand Leons POV, I can. He goes to hell for this girl, probably idolizes her while those months while they don't see each other and when he finally does, she's not the big damn hero anymore. Ouch, that must sting. So I am very interested in how the story continues. Will there be a happy ending? As the author does not fear character deaths, I feel everything is open. I particularly I guess we should watch out for the younger brother...a spurned love is an incalculable thing and the people are on the verge of rioting...still. Hope the story does not end predictably - Leon dies a hero's death and sacrifices himself for Gaia, which ends up heartbroken but still marrying Will. Something like that. OR: She solved the puzzle in the 1st book wrong and Leon is in fact her brother. They share more similarities and the brother she discovered looked nothing like her parents. Besides rioting in the enclave, Gaia now also has to lead a whole town to the desert. Has something like religious leader, right? While this is always the point with YA books - they try to make the MC so plain that the reader can still identify them, although they need to be special enough to make them an MC after all. Here it is done by giving her a scar, a good story behind it to. The job as a midwife, the authority that comes with it and the courageous action she takes when she sees something wrong make her unique.",4,young_adult,"['love', 'read', 'book', 'well', 'installment', 'think', 'interesting', 'concept', 'introduce', 'patriarchic', 'society', 'matriarchic', 'society', 'reveal', 'fact', 'evil', 'justice', 'man', 'woman', 'equal', 'injustice', 'matriarchic', 'feel', 'real', 'harsh', 'describe', 'want', 'patriarchic', 'society', 'reader', 'believe', 'heartbeat', 'end', 'history', 'present', 'woops', 'feminist', 'view', 'come', 'sorry', 'like', 'humor', 'plot', 'character', 'like', 'morally_grey', 'disappointing', 'main_character', 'stalwart', 'true', 'gaia', 'get', 'think', 'action', 'ok', 'reviewer', 'understand', 'leons', 'pov', 'go', 'hell', 'girl', 'probably', 'idolize', 'month', 'finally', 'big', 'damn', 'hero', 'anymore', 'ouch', 'sting', 'interested', 'story', 'continue', 'happy_ending', 'author', 'fear', 'character', 'death', 'feel', 'open', 'particularly', 'guess', 'watch', 'young', 'brother', 'spurn', 'love', 'incalculable', 'thing', 'people', 'verge', 'rioting', 'hope', 'story', 'end', 'predictably', 'leon', 'die', 'hero', 'death', 'sacrifice', 'gaia', 'end', 'heartbroken', 'marry', 'like', 'solve', 'puzzle', 'book', 'wrong', 'leon', 'fact', 'brother', 'share', 'similarity', 'brother', 'discover', 'look', 'like', 'parent', 'rioting', 'enclave', 'gaia', 'lead', 'town', 'desert', 'like', 'religious', 'leader', 'right', 'point', 'ya', 'book', 'try', 'mc', 'plain', 'reader', 'identify', 'need', 'special', 'mc', 'give', 'scar', 'good', 'story', 'job', 'midwife', 'authority', 'come', 'courageous', 'action', 'take', 'see', 'wrong', 'unique']"
428,"This is a reread. You can find my 2015 review below. 2016 Review. Still two stars. UNDER THE NEVER SKY is one of those books that I really want to like, for some inexplicable reason. I know that I love the atmosphere of the story, and I know that I love the potential. But on the whole, the execution itself just falls flat for me. Maybe this is a personal issue, but I just can't see past all the weaknesses in the plot. However, that being said, it does feel rather weird to rate this book only two stars, since I don't dislike it. In fact, I would probably rate the experience of reading it closer to three stars, which is what I usually give a book I love but have major issues with, versus two stars, which is what I give a book I mostly hated. But again, I can't quite see past all the major flaws in the story itself, despite my enjoyment, and I think it would be more honest to rate this one according to the merit I see in the story, rather than the enjoyment I get from it. If that makes any sense. I realize my rating system is horribly inconsistent, and I'm sorry. I am trying to find a good middle ground so I don't confuse anyone, but it may take some time and some tweaking. I still would recommend this book to people who love dystopian literature, because I do think it captures some of the important elements that I love in dystopians. Again, this is probably just a personality thing, so if you want to read this book, by all means, do so. My rating is rather an unpopular opinion anyway, and I'm aware of that. I have the two sequels now, and I plan to read those soon. Hopefully I will enjoy those more. I do think Veronica Rossi has a lot of potential as an author, and I do plan to keep up with her writing as best as I can. Content Warning. Two of the characters do have sex in a rather vague, non-explicit scene. 2015 Review. Two stars. On the whole, I don't think UNDER THE NEVER SKY lives up to its potential. While there were things I genuinely liked about it, I spent most of the book feeling disinterested and disappointed. I mean, the first bit of action with Aria is great and I was all excited for a sci-fi, dystopian with lots of mental landscapes and hordes of people who can't bear reality. Then the narrative switched to Peregrine's view point, and I just got kind of...bored. Sure, he's a cool guy who can smell people's emotions and see well in the dark. Plus he's hot (according to Aria). What's not to like about him? But he lives in a village and hunts for a living and deals with typical medievalish problems. That's not to say I don't like stories about that sort of thing, but I was expecting UNDER THE NEVER SKY to be techy and cool and futuristic. I was not prepared for chickens and blood lords and savages with weird super senses. Probably this is my fault, because if I had read enough about the book before I started, I would have known what I was getting into. My bad. However, I was thrown off for other reasons as well. The romance is creepy and weird, and the transformation between ""I hate you"" to ""I love you"" hinges on a rather superficial event. Not to mention, it's a tad upsetting to know Perry can smell all of Aria's emotions (and he won't stop sniffing her #awkward). Give poor Aria a little privacy, please and thank you. What disappointed me the most, though, was the dystopian element itself. For one thing, Perry's culture, which takes up most of the book, doesn't feel hugely dystopian. I mean, sure, Perry and his brother (who happens to be in charge) don't get along, and the Aether might possibly torch the place, and the people might starve. But none of those things are characteristically dystopian, in the strictest sense--they just happen to be obstacles in the way of happily ever after. For another thing, I wanted to spend more time in the Pods. The people of Reverie (one of the Pods), always wear Smarteyes, devices that allow them to live in hundreds of virtual realms while they go about their daily lives. Aria has been told that people began using Smarteyes as means of entertainment because the Pods are super boring. But that feels like an overly simplistic answer. I want to know why people chose unproductive technology over other forms of entertainment, such as invention and industry and physical play. I want to know the deep hurts in society--the roots of this issue. The Smarteyes--the need to constantly daydream and the fulfillment thereof--are a symptom, and I want to know the cause. Rossi doesn't dwell on that. Maybe she expands the sci-fi and psychological elements further in the rest of the trilogy (which I do plan to read at some point), but I would have appreciated a more solid first book.",2,young_adult,"['reread', 'find', 'review', 'review', 'star', 'sky', 'book', 'want', 'like', 'inexplicable', 'reason', 'know', 'love', 'atmosphere', 'story', 'know', 'love', 'potential', 'execution', 'fall_flat', 'maybe', 'personal', 'issue', 'past', 'weakness', 'plot', 'say', 'feel', 'weird', 'rate', 'book', 'star', 'dislike', 'fact', 'probably', 'rate', 'experience', 'read', 'close', 'star', 'usually', 'book', 'love', 'major', 'issue', 'versus', 'star', 'book', 'hate', 'past', 'major', 'flaw', 'story', 'despite', 'enjoyment', 'think', 'honest', 'rate', 'accord', 'merit', 'story', 'enjoyment', 'make_sense', 'realize', 'rating', 'system', 'horribly', 'inconsistent', 'sorry', 'try', 'find', 'good', 'middle', 'ground', 'confuse', 'time', 'tweaking', 'recommend', 'book', 'people', 'love', 'dystopian', 'literature', 'think', 'capture', 'important_element', 'love', 'dystopian', 'probably', 'personality', 'thing', 'want', 'read', 'book', 'mean', 'rating', 'unpopular', 'opinion', 'aware', 'sequel', 'plan', 'read', 'soon', 'hopefully', 'enjoy', 'think', 'veronica', 'rossi', 'lot', 'potential', 'author', 'plan', 'write', 'well', 'content_warning', 'character', 'sex', 'vague', 'non', 'explicit', 'scene', 'review', 'star', 'think', 'sky', 'live', 'potential', 'thing', 'genuinely', 'like', 'spend', 'book', 'feel', 'disinterested', 'disappointed', 'mean', 'bit', 'action', 'aria', 'great', 'excited', 'sci_fi', 'dystopian', 'lot', 'mental', 'landscape', 'horde', 'people', 'bear', 'reality', 'narrative', 'switch', 'peregrine', 'view', 'point', 'get', 'kind', 'bored', 'sure', 'cool', 'guy', 'smell', 'people', 'emotion', 'dark', 'plus', 'hot', 'accord', 'aria', 'like', 'live', 'village', 'hunt', 'living', 'deal', 'typical', 'medievalish', 'problem', 'like', 'story', 'sort', 'thing', 'expect', 'sky', 'techy', 'cool', 'futuristic', 'prepare', 'chicken', 'blood', 'lord', 'savage', 'weird', 'super', 'sense', 'probably', 'fault', 'read', 'book', 'start', 'know', 'get', 'bad', 'throw', 'reason', 'romance', 'creepy', 'weird', 'transformation', 'hate', 'love', 'hinge', 'superficial', 'event', 'mention', 'tad', 'upsetting', 'know', 'perry', 'smell', 'aria', 'emotion', 'will', 'stop', 'sniff', 'awkward', 'poor', 'aria', 'little', 'privacy', 'thank', 'disappoint', 'dystopian', 'element', 'thing', 'perry', 'culture', 'take', 'book', 'feel', 'hugely', 'dystopian', 'mean', 'sure', 'perry', 'brother', 'happen', 'charge', 'aether', 'possibly', 'torch', 'place', 'people', 'starve', 'thing', 'characteristically', 'dystopian', 'strict', 'sense', 'happen', 'obstacle', 'way', 'happily', 'thing', 'want', 'spend_time', 'pods', 'people', 'reverie', 'pods', 'wear', 'smarteyes', 'device', 'allow', 'live', 'hundred', 'virtual', 'realm', 'daily', 'life', 'aria', 'tell', 'people', 'begin', 'smarteyes', 'mean', 'entertainment', 'pods', 'super', 'boring', 'feel', 'like', 'overly', 'simplistic', 'answer', 'want', 'know', 'people', 'choose', 'unproductive', 'technology', 'form', 'entertainment', 'invention', 'industry', 'physical', 'play', 'want', 'know', 'deep', 'hurt', 'society', 'root', 'issue', 'smarteyes', 'need', 'constantly', 'daydream', 'fulfillment', 'thereof', 'symptom', 'want', 'know', 'cause', 'rossi', 'dwell', 'maybe', 'expand', 'sci_fi', 'psychological', 'element', 'rest', 'trilogy', 'plan', 'read', 'point', 'appreciate', 'solid', 'book']"
429,"*4.5 stars* There's a lot to love about this book! Simon is a high school junior, gay but not out, who has the misfortune of leaving his email open on a school computer. Martin takes advantage of the email he reads to blackmail Simon into playing matchmaker. This email? It's to ""Blue,"" a young man also going to the high school, for whom Simon has a LOT in common. But Blue is far from being comfortable with coming out, much less letting Simon know who he actually is. I really liked Simon, ""Blue,"" Simon's friends, and his sisters. Everyone was interesting and authentic, with even Martin showing there was more to him than evil blackmailer (not that that excuses blackmailing. Nope nope nope). They're into drama, rehearsing for a play, and Simon's still adjusting to one sister leaving for college, and the other being largely unavailable. There's also Abby, a newcomer to Simon's group of friends, straight from DC and full of ideas (and songs! I liked the romance between Simon and ""Blue,"" and how most people had Simon's back  when the blackmailing inevitably went sour, and Simon was outed at school and home . What did make me uncomfortable, and turned this from a 5 star read to a 4 1/2 star one, was Simon's surprise that ""Blue"" ended up being Gram, soccer player extraordinaire and person of color. I DID like that Simon examined this bias, just for a moment. But then there were many, many descriptions of Gram's brown skin, how tantalizing this looked from a pair of torn jeans, how much Simon liked his skin, that felt a tad like exoticism. That said, Gram isn't the only POC in this diverse cast of characters, so maybe this deserves a pass . Overall, I really enjoyed this book.

432,"I read the reviews that my GR friends wrote about Panic -- and even though I didn't look at the blurb between deciding to buy it and reading it (only three months but my memory is terrible), I do agree that the blurb is quite bad compared to what the book is actually about. Sure, it says that Panic is a game that is played... but the blurb does not capture any of the outright terror that Panic causes... the adrenaline rushes that the reader feels along with the contestants. Nor does the blurb really talk at all about how very dangerous Panic can be. I really enjoyed Panic, but I kind of wish that it hadn't ended quite so abruptly. I loved the final image -- when Heather won Joust, survived the bomb that she didn't know was in the car, and stood there with her hand on Anne's lost tiger's head. It just seemed so... fitting.

433,"I'm a writer. And when I read a book, I often notice little writery tricks. I can see where the story is going, and I can appreicate it on a technical level. But, what sets a story/book apart for me, is its ability to make me forget I'm a writer. Make me forget it's following certain paths that stories take. Make me hope and wish for something that the logical part of my brain knows can't happen. Make me forget I'm reading a story but instead glimpsing a slice of some other place. Flesh & Bone did this. This was the follow up to Rot & Ruin I wanted Dust & Decay to be. R&R wowed me with story craft, clever characters, and a brutal world I wanted to see more of. Flesh & Bone took me there emotionally. I hung on the edge of each page, devouring the story. While not a perfect piece of literature, there is something raw and powerful in this book. And crazy cults help too. The book starts one month after the events of Dust & Decay and happens over the course of a very eventful day. Characters struggle with depression, zombies, and crazy death cults, all with a hint that maybe, just maybe their quest isn't worthless. The fact that the events in this book took place over a day didn't bother me. (Usually it does.) This is primarily due to the POV shifts throughout the book. I do have one complaint: I really didn't care for the POV of our villains and various cult members. I sort of wonder if it was padding to expand the story. But I do think that because the book is a record of the course of a single day that keeps it from suffering the middle book syndrome that drove me nuts in Dust & Decay. It's the time frame that makes it a complete book, though, there's clearly still story to tell. Flesh & Bone also recaptured what I loved most about Rot & Ruin - the world building. We've finally expanded beyond the borders of the Nine Towns and a small part of California. We learn that there is much moving in the world, and the world is struggling to continue. These details are so well constructed that it makes me excited just to know more. More of this world Benny, Nix, Chong, and Lilah inhabit. But what really brings Book 3 into the spotlight is how it excellently handles the themes of grief. Everyone around them is dying, and they are struggling to keep a float. There are many who keep strong, and many who succumb to darker desires. It's so beautifully portrayed and it gets to some of the core of being human. The will to live. And isn't that what zombie books are about? Though, I did learn that the thing I hate most about zombie stories is that someone has to die. And I knew from chapter 1, that it was going to be Chong. Chong's death and Sanctuary are so beautiful, so moving, it's hard for me to describe. I get misty-eyed just thinking about it. When does the next one come out? Please tell me soon.

435,"I received a free copy via edelweiss for review purposes. I was initially drawn to One because of the cover, because it is lovely. Then I read the synopsis and I knew I needed this book in my life. I'm a twin myself, though not conjoined, but I really did feel connected to both Grace and Tippi. One is an emotional and moving story of two totally connected girls. It is written in verse, which is a first for me, and so One is a quick and easy read - but tissues are required. Tippi and Grace share everything, even their body. They've lived their entire lives together, so being so close is normal for them. They don't know any different. And they love each other, so why risk separation when it is so dangerous? But then their bodies are fighting against them and they have no choice but to face up to the thing they have been avoiding their entire lives. It is rare I find a book that captures the essence of twins so honestly and realistically. I'm not conjoined, and I don't know what it is like. But I do know what it is like to have that one person you are so undeniably close to. That you don't know what you would do without them. In that respect, I totally understood Grace and Tippi. How much they adored each other. So naturally that ending left me in tears because it was such a horrible thing to happen and I feel for Grace so much. I don't want to say much else for fear of spoiling so I'm jut going to stay how much I loved this book.

437,"What I Liked These days, a young adult novel written in third person is difficult to find. And Lauren Oliver nailed this POV. Panic is not a sci-fi, dystopian story. It's set in a real-world small town that is riddled with relative poverty and all the issues that come along with that. The characters living in Carp are realistic and tangible. Even the kindest characters Anne  have deeply-etched flaws. The character development in this novel is striking and intensely psychological. I appreciated how Panic portrayed life in a poor, small town. Everyone is desperate and struggling, unable to get by and also unable to get away. $67,000 means everything to a teen who has no chance of a better future without some kind of stepping stone. Nat's story was perhaps the most compelling of the entire novel. What I Didn't Like Even though the intense depth of the characters in Panic was amazing, I never actually liked any of them very much. Instead of finding myself rooting for a winner of the games, I found myself distracted by the extreme selfishness and foolishness in every single character I encountered. There never seemed to be a pure motivation behind anyone's actionsuntil Bishop announcing why he was judge, but even that caused extreme property damage and injury that the reader was basically supposed to ignore . I found myself irritated with Heather, Nat, Bishop, and Dodge more than I found myself rooting for any of them. At times, the challenges seemed a little too extreme to be real, especially if this is an annual thing that police had never stopped before. Burning a house down? Playing Russian Roulette?

439,"I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this one. I can't remember the last time I read a book this modern and found myself as invested as I would be a fantasy book. Granted, by no means was a this a contemporary. This is a weird mixture of sci-fi, modern young adult love, and historical fiction and somehow it works. The author does a really making sure you don't get lost in all the different dimensions or feel overwhelmed by all the jumping around, which I feel is commendable considering how easily it would be to get lost in a plot like this. I also really enjoyed how she started this book and introduced you the world and its characters. You're thrown right into the action and the history you need filters in later, very timely and cleverly, I might add. My favorite aspect of this book had to be in the Russian bit. Which doesn't surprise me one bit because I have an extreme fascination with royals and anything excluding modern technology. But more than that, the characters that were introduced in that portion of the book were wonderful and this was the part that got the most emotionally invested in the story. I loved Lieutenant Markov. If I had to choose between him and actual Paul, right now, I'd pick him. And I was so shocked and upset when he died. I felt so bad for the Grand Duchess and it took me a second to read on after that. I hated leaving that dimension so quickly after the fact. I really hope we get to go back to that dimension somehow. If only to see how those characters were affected by what actually happened. The only thing that kept me from giving this a full five star rating is the romance. Don't get me wrong the romance is good and I do love Paul. It's just... complicated. The whole I'm in love with this Paul who might be my Paul but isn't really and I can't be with my Paul because I'm still mourning the Russian Paul even though technically he wasn't mine to love because he loved the Grand Duchess. It's a little strange and I hope she gets over it fast. You'll have to read it to understand but I have a feeling I'm in for a long, drawn out bit of pinning and pain until the end of the series. Authors really do love to torture their readers. Overall, I really did like this book. It was a good break from the heavy fantasy I've been reading lately while still keeping enough of the unbelievable element as not to bore me with standard contemporary.

440,"Even though I've really enjoyed Kimberly Derting's other novels, The Taking ended up being a middle of the road read for me. Even though the premise sounded like something that would be perfect for me, there were little things about the characters and their reactions that really put a damper on things. That said, the ending was strong enough that I am very curious about where the story will go and will probably read the next one for that reason. While I'd love to say it took a while, The Taking went sideways on me almost immediately. Kyra gets into a fight with her father and insists that he let her out of the car in the middle of a highway. And he complies. What? Who is the authority figure in this relationship? If I was throwing a tantrum, 18 or not, my parents would never have let me out on the side of a highway. I don't know anyone else whose parents would have either. It just started the novel out on the complete wrong foot for me. Then, almost immediately after this fight when Kyra wakes up 5 years later, she ends up falling for her now ex-boyfriend's little brother. Most of you probably know how I feel about sibling triangles. HATE. Hate, hate, hate. And then when you consider that from Kyra's perspective, she was dating her ex-boyfriend just yesterday that makes it so much worse. She was convinced she was going to marry him, and while high school relationships hardly ever last, even though she is upset that he's gone she moves on pretty quickly with HIS BROTHER. Ew. Aside from the issues I had relating to the character's actions, I did really like the plot. The mystery behind Kyra's disappearance was interesting, and I wan't expecting it to work out the way it did. Can't say that much more about it without ruining the plot, but it definitely saved the book for me. Even though I was really frustrated with the characters throughout the entire novel, the plot did a pretty good job of redeeming the novel.

441,"Okay, so I loved this. I have a bit of a weird relationship with John Green's book. I really like him as a person and enjoy watching his videos, but his books... Looking for Alaska and Paper Towns were just okay to me and I absolutely hated An Abundance of Katherines. I loved TFioS when I first read it, but reviews etc have made me wonder whether I'd still like it if I ever reread it. This book, though, was really great. The star of this book was without a doubt the descriptions of Aza's mind. It was fascinating and terrifying and it felt entirely real. Aza is very different from me, but I did recognise a lot of her thoughts about her mental state and the consequences of it. Like not being able to control your thoughts and the fear that it's never going to get any better. I loved that the consequences for the people around her were also discussed. Because yes, mental illness can make someone self centered. And yes, relationships with people with mental illness can be hard. This was really shown in Aza's relationships with Daisy and Davis. The friendship with Daisy was great, I love how that was explored. I really liked Davis and Aza together but I loved that they didn't end up together. I don't think Aza was ready for the kind of relationship Davis wanted and sometimes it's just better to not stay in each other's lives, even if you love each other. Their relationship was just a part of Aza's story and I loved that. I didn't care all that much about the plot concerning where Davis' dad was, except for what it meant for the characters. The mystery really wasn't the point anyway, though. Just a base to tell this story around. There were a few small things that bugged me a little: - Davis giving Aza 100.000 dollars felt weird. It was basically hush money and I didn't really know how to feel about that. - Aza didn't consistently take her meds for most of the book. Overal the book was positive about medication, which was great, but it always frustrates me when a character doesn't take her meds and then says they're not working. But I guess that was part of her journey. I absolutely loved the ending. No magical fixes, no unrealistic romantic bliss, no bullshit. Just life. The good and the bad of life. Beautifully narrated by an older Aza who found happiness in her life while still struggling with her mind. It's realistic and hopeful and I loved it. The audio for this was really great too.

442,"Don't get me wrong: this was a very good book, but I felt that it had a lot of potential which was not fully used. THE GOOD: The DIVERSITY! Oh, how I love diverse YA books. In this, we have a plus size girl of colour and a gay protagonist, whose whole characterisation is not based solely on his sexuality. There is also a young Polish boy. The characters themselves were quite likeable, particularly Tomasz the young Polish boy and Gudmund to begin with (before he slept with Monica  ). I also found myself really liking and sympathising with Seth's dad. The BEGINNING! Oh my gosh, what an intriguing way to start a story. It ensures you are engrossed straight away and remains that way. The writing style in this book was perfect. It was to the point and avoided becoming too descriptive in order to sustain an air of suspense. The subsequent plot twist that is revealed was also intriguing and full of potential, which I feel was not properly used, bringing me on to... THE BAD: As you may have noticed, the main character (Seth) was not on my list of likeable characters and that's because he seemed like such a shadow. I disliked Seth. I felt nothing towards him. If anything happened to him, I didn't feel any sadness or worry. He didn't have much of a personality apart from the fact that he moaned and whined a lot. He felt more like a detached narrator than the person whose point of view this story was being told from. I found the first part of the book where Seth is alone and confused  really boring and repetitive, only enjoying the flashbacks he had. After Seth finds Tomasz and Regine, though, things started to get far more interesting . After that we find out far more, but there is still so much that is left unanswered:  why were Seth and Regine alone in their houses but no one else was? Will the driver come back? If not, who is going to look after the people who are online if something goes wrong?. I guess the answer is supposed to be that life does not always have the answers, however I felt as thought there was just no closure. Despite the negatives this was an incredibly engaging book, shown by the fact that I am writing this review retrospectively and I still remember almost all of what happened. This is an encouraging sign of a memorable story, for which Ness is gifted for writing. He disallows his ideas to leave your mind and has you constantly questioning things even after you've left the world of his book.

443,"Seriously dunno what to think.. This was my reaction to most of this novel. While the concept of this book tackles a philosophical issue, is it possible to still be alive and conscious in a divided state? I along with the three heroes of this book thought being unwound (having your body more or less cut up and your body parts used on other people) meant death for sure. But it was revealed at the end when a lot of people with the parts of one boy came together and all the people experienced the feelings and thoughts of the unwound boy. So Neal obviously thinks it's possible to live in a divided state . Even with this book being ""right up my street"", I didn't enjoy it that much. Or at least not as much as everyone else. I felt like it went on for too long, especially at the Graveyard. But this book promises a real ""change the world"" adventure with more epicness to come. So, while I found the conclusion of this book a little far fetched, it definitely had me wondering and thinking about what unwinding would do to one's soul... So I will continue reading this series...

444,"Possible trigger warnings: abuse*, teen pregnancy, suicide*, transphobia, cancer, parental death* *these don't happen during the course of the book, but are mentioned This review was originally posted on my blog. Why have I not read Emery Lord's writing before?! I own two of her other books and yet this is the first time I'm actually reading something she's written. Let me say, though, that will certainly be fixed very soon. After reading The Names They Gave Us, I have fallen in love with Emery Lord's writing and will definitely be reading more by her. I'll admit that I was a little nervous that the religious aspects would ruin it for me. I'm an atheist and tend to get annoyed if books (or any other media) try to push religious beliefs. But I'm very happy to say that this ended up being a totally unnecessary fear. Lucy is religious, yes, and it does play a role in the book, but the book never felt ""preachy"" to me. None of the religious characters try to push their faith on other people which I really appreciated. I actually really enjoyed reading about Lucy's faith and felt her questioning of it felt real and authentic. As you might expect with a book that takes place at a camp for troubled kids, there are some tough subjects that come up. Off the top of my head, some of the topics that I remember coming up were abuse, suicide, transphobia, and parental death (I promise I'm not spoiling anything by mentioning these). I felt that all of these subjects were handled pretty well (although I'm not really the best person to talk about most of these issues). They aren't done for shock value nor are they handled insensitively. They're really just a part of these characters and help explain why some of them act the way they do. This cast of characters is 100% what really made this book for me. All of the characters are so wonderful in their own ways. The other camp counselors are especially great, as they're all so supportive of each other and of the campers. Lord really wrote some fantastic friendships in this. The characters are pretty diverse too. There are several POC in the main group as well as a trans girl. Racism doesn't really become incorporated into the book, but transphobia is mentioned at times, but again, I didn't notice any big issues with how it was handled (but like I mentioned, I'm not the best person to speak on that as I'm cis). There were some pretty funny little comments made, especially when Lucy first arrives at the camp and the others are trying to figure out what kind of person she is - is she judgmental? accepting? They aren't really sure what to expect from her and seeing the characters try to figure her out was quite entertaining at times. One thing that could have been improved is the way the whole ""family secrets"" thing was handled. It's not that it was portrayed poorly, but it really didn't come into play until the very end of the novel. Based on the blurb, I expected it to be more integrated into the story and so I was a little thrown off by how late in the book it actually comes up. I'll also admit it's pretty easy to figure out what the big secret is if you know to look for clues. Ultimately, though, I loved the story we got so much that I really didn't care. I cannot close out this review without mentioning how much I adored the romance between Lucy and a fellow counselor, Jones. I won't go into too much detail because I don't want to spoil anything for people who are planning on reading this, but man, were they adorable. I was smiling uncontrollably reading some of the scenes with them. They were just so freaking cute!! And extra bonus points because they're an interracial couple. I really can't do justice to The Names They Gave Us in this review. This book will have you laughing in one chapter and crying the next and you'll love every minute of it. It's been awhile since I've so thoroughly enjoyed a book. If even a small part of this book has you interested, you must give it a try because chances are you'll really end up enjoying it.

445,"I really loved this! ""To all the boys I've loved before"" is such a unique and diverse novel and a wonderful addition to the YA contemporary genre. All the characters felt very well developed and I connected to most of them, except for Kitty who was kind of annoying. But all in all, the relationship between the Song sisters was one of my favourite parts of this book! Everything about this story was just so cute and relatable. I loved all the smaller plot lines that went into it and made Lara Jean's life so realistic because this book doesn't only focus on romance. Of course, the love story is the main part of this book but it also deals with family, friendships and some highschool drama, which may seem annoying but made this book even more enjoyable for me. I completely understood and agreed with Lara Jean's feelings and uncertainty towards the boys and her fear of losing people and growing apart, which is an important topic in YA literature. The thing that probably stuck out to me the most was that being uncertain about love and maybe having feelings for multiple people at once was never portrayed as a bad or reprehensible, but as a natural part of life. I'm looking forward to continuing with the series and can't wait to get my hands on the next book! And hopefully she'll end up with a boy nicer than Peter, even though I highly doubt it.

446,"I wanted to give this book three stars, and I thought I would throughout the first half/three quarters of the book. I am NOT a John Green fan. I understand why his writing is appealing to some, but I tend to find it pretentious and filled with characters that I can't relate to. But SO many people urged me to read this one and ultimately it got to me.

447,"This review is also featured on my blog, the Snark Theater. 2.5 stars So I had this whole rant planned about how this book was like a reverse Song of Achilles for me. Deeply personal, just...in all the worst ways. I also had this really great metaphor planned about the mirror from the Snow Queen, which only shows you the bad parts about yourself, and how this was how reading this book felt like for me. Ari Mendoza is a lot like teenage me. Well, teenage me, if I'd been Mexican American and if I'd been born some fifteen-ish years earlier. If you've read my reviews and think I'm overly verbose, well be glad you don't hear my inner monologue. Though you can get an idea by reading this book. I could have written a check list with everything Ari thought or did and I'd probably have checked most of them as things I did or thought as a teenager. And probably even as things I do now. But...none of them are things I'm proud of. I also had a few more rants in mind, like talking about the fact that contemporary/non fantasy books aren't for me, but that this is one of the better iterations of that genre. Or talking about the fact that this book doesn't have a very structured plot, and that yes, real life can be like that, but at the same time not really. I even planned to tell the story of my first and currently only crush as an example that stories do in fact have beginnings, middles and ends, but you can only identify those with hindsight. But that is all rendered irrelevant by the ending. Oh god what the fuck was that. Ari's parents sitting him down and telling him ""you're in love with this guy because you saved his life and beat up this guy who put him in the hospital""? What? The fuck? What are friends for? And Ari claiming that all his angst and misery was caused by refusing to acknowledge his feelings for Dante? Feelings that weren't foreshadowed in any way as anything else than platonic? While on the other hand his angst and misery were established as being there before he even met Dante? Yeah, I call bullshit. You know, I should probably take down another star to my rating just for that, but I won't, because I feel like it wouldn't be fair to the book, hence the ""2.5 stars"" thing. Beware the incoming tangent, but...see, I hate Cassandra Clare. I've said it before, and it has to do with her online history and the cult-like way she's still dealing with her fandom. But I don't hate her books so much as I regret their lost potential. However, I do hate elements about her books. At the top of that list is Alec's coming out in City of Glass, because 1) consequences, but 2) Alec is described as happier and more comfortable and better for it. Well, this is the same problem. Coming out doesn't solve anything that is unrelated to your sexuality. I would know. I was out as bisexual at the age of fourteen. I pretended to date a guy at the age of fifteen (it was complicated and messy but for other reasons), that's how out I was. And yet, as I said when I began this review, I still had the same teenage angst Aristotle Mendoza has. So, no, I don't believe that him accepting his feelings and getting a boyfriend is going to change any of that. And I feel somewhat insulted by the very notion of it. So...in conclusion. Yeah, it's a cute book, with a cute romance (though the resolution comes straight of nowhere and is completely divorced from the protagonist's agency, which is never a good thing in my book), and teenagers who sound like teenagers. Sometimes I got a hunch of the ""what teenager speaks like this? "", but the truth is, I spoke like that. If anything, it's only weirding me out because Ari supposedly has bad vocabulary (hell, I had better vocabulary in English at the same age and it's not even my first language), and it strikes me as something that would be related to being so ""deep"", introspective and pseudo-philosophical. But whatever, I don't mind that. And it's a deeply unsettling book, in a way that I think is intentional, and thus, mostly a good thing, even if I don't particularly like it. But I can't endorse it any more than that. The ending basically made the whole thing fall apart. Fuck you kind sir, I'm not here for this ""Come out; you'll be better for it!"" bullshit, which to me will always reek of bad straight allies (disclaimer: I don't know the author's sexual orientation, nor do I really care). Especially when the story arc that preceded that moment was about Dante getting beaten up for being out.
